- Added support for upgrading Mist settings from build to build
- Improved IsDirty tracking on *.mst file
- Product key is now hidden in account control to prevent inadvertent key disclosure during demos or videos
- Fixed issue where "Open In Windows Explorer" from the MDI document tab would not work for BimlScript Designer windows

- Added support for project level encryption and the ProjectPassword property on PackageProjects


**Biml API**

- Added timeout support to all of the database providers and external data access methods
- Fixed issue where properties changed via API were not being reflected in GetBiml output
- Added GetDataTable support for most major DbConnection types
- Added AstRootNode convenience collections for FlatFileFormats, RawFileFormats, PackageProjects, and CubeProjects
- Fixed issue where AstRootNode convenience collections did not support name-based indexing in Live mode
- Fixed an issue where StructureEquals was producing incorrect results due to a missing negation operator in autogenerated code


**Biml Compiler**

- Improved compiler version information in MSBuild and bimlc.exe
- Added ability to get machine code from bimlc.exe
- Added support for SsisExternalColumnsQueryTimeout option to globally override SSIS external metadata discovery time outs
- Fixed issue with output paths being dynamically created and references being broken in XmlSource node

- Fixed issue where MSBuild would hang and peg the CPU if a built-in transformer framework failed
- Added package password handling to BimlDriver and BimlEngine MSBuild task
- Fixed a bug in AnalysisServicesProcessing emitter where parallel processing order would not be handled properly in some cases
- Changed compiler/msbuild option for SSIS encryption password from PackagePassword to the more inclusive SsisEncryptionPassword
- Added warning level option (/warn=0 or /p:Warn=0) so that warnings can be turned off
- Fixed nested includes so that class type members also can nest (i.e. <#+ #> blocks)


**BimlScript Errors/Warnings**

- Added file name to errors/warnings created from BimlScript directives
- Added warning when build-only assets cannot be located
- Improved validation reporting in Metadata model dynamic objects
- Added an error for duplicate dataflow column nodes.  This usually arises with "reserved" column names "ErrorCode" and "ErrorText"
- Fixed issue where errors in nested includes were not being reported
- Added a warning and an automatic patch of import statements that use the old Hadron namespaces
- Fixed an issue where SSIS emitter was incorrectly producing a "not supported" error on some file resources
- Added support to ValidationItems to track if they were from .NET code nugget error or other error
- Fixed sorting of line and column fields in validation grid (numerical sorting instead of lexicographic sorting)


**Database Providers and Type Mappings**

- Fixed a type mapping bug in XmlSource
- Fixed a bug for configurations of Oracle that do not supply IsByteSemantic with column metadata
- Fixed a few minor Teradata type mapping issues
- Fixed Oracle datatype mapping in decimals
- Significantly improved DatabaseProviderSelector to more closely match Mist 3.4.  Most notably, this will fix issues where ADO.NET connections were largely ignoring the provider setting
- Fixed a crash that can occur in an internal method for creating database connection strings when the provider type of the underlying connection cannot be detected.
- Fix for Oracle schema provider logic so that fallback will use OracleConnection type rather than Odbc connection
- Fixed data type mapping on import for XML column length and sysname


**SSIS Emission**

- Fixed issue where Ssis2014 packages were not having their nodes sorted correctly
- Added support for EncryptAllWithUserKey and EncryptAllWithPassword to SsisEmitter
- Turned off an SSIS bug workaround in AdoNetDestination emitter for 2012+ since SSIS fixed it in the 2012 release
- Fixed CDC Source emitter to use the actual specified time out instead of a hardcoded value
- Fixed an issue with AdoNetSource emitter where it would not convert a WSTR with length greater than 4000 to an NTEXT

- Fixed minor issue with emission of corrupt packages when using PDW with a 2008 target
- Fixed issue with DataType emission in downlevel SSIS targets
- Fixed bugs in Odbc Source and Destination where properties were not being emitted with the correct notification or type translator settings
- Minor fixes for PDW and Teradata destination emission

- Fix for an SSIS expression evaluation error related to casting integers to date times
- Added emission of synthetic connection manager parameters to project manifest via the connection manager translators
- Fixed issue where script tasks in 2014 would ask to be upgraded by BIDS
- Fixed issue where synthetic types like (Web Servbive Type) in script project settings would produce bad code behind during build
- Fixed issue where ISPac files were losing unicode characters


**SSIS Import**

- Fixed scrolling for large numbers of imported assets
- Applied file extension filters to file dialog boxes
- Fixed an issue where the LabeledFileSelector control would grow forever off the edge of the dialog
- Added a warnings and errors display on import
- Added a warning when placeholder connections are created for project connections imported from a DTSX file
- Fixed issue where CDC Source components were being imported as custom components
- Fixed issue where CDC Control task import was not correctly importing the StateVariable
- Prevented duplicate import of project connections referenced by packages
- Fixed issue where DTProj files without manifests were not being correctly imported
- Fixed issue where hex codes (for things like flat file delimiters) would not be properly imported
- Added option to automatically add a Biml annotation to imported SSIS object to indicate their source package
- Added option to add annotations to destination components with unmapped external columns
