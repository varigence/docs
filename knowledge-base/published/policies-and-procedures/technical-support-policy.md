# Overview

Varigence is dedicated to resolving the complex issues arising from metadata-driven solutions and data automations of our customers. Our commitment extends to offering expert technical assistance and powerful solutions through our software. The Varigence Support team, comprised of professionals with expertise in data automation, data modeling, and code generation, ensures our customers harness the full potential of our products to meet their data objectives and build robust frameworks. 

These technical support policies are subject to modification at Varigence’s discretion.  
 

# Requirements 

To be eligible to receive technical support from Varigence as described further below: 

*   All software must be properly licensed through Varigence or an authorized reseller. 
    
*   Users must be compliant with the terms and conditions set forth in the Varigence End User License Agreement (EULA). 
    
*   Users must maintain an active contract for SMU (Support, Maintenance, and Upgrades). 
    

*   Software licensed as a subscription will contain SMU coverage so long as the account is in good standing.  
    
*   Software sold as a perpetual license will require a separate SMU contract available at the time of purchase and renewable at any time.
    

# Supported Applications 

Varigence offers technical customer support for its BimlFlex and BimlStudio applications. Varigence does not offer any support for BimlExpress. 

# Support Coverage 

Varigence Support addresses problem resolution through several mechanisms, including basic technical guidance, defining workarounds, logging bugs, providing bespoke patches (where appropriate), and through routine software releases with fixes and feature additions included based on severity and priority.

Varigence strives to provide comprehensive customer support for a wide range of solutions to various issues. These issues include, but are not limited to project metadata review, assessment of faulty code generation, and general software-related defects (e.g. actions not performing “as defined” or incorrect functionality). If a defect is identified in Varigence software or its code generation, Varigence Support will log the issue and coordinate with the development team to define and triage the issue. When possible, an issue severity and resolution timeframe will be communicated to the customer for both critical and minor bug fixes.  
 

# Support Limitations 

Varigence products are designed as development tools to enable customers to write code that can be executed on their local systems. As a result, customers may experience issues that are not related to defects in Varigence products or documentation, but rather arise from misconfigured local environments, inexperience with the application’s functionalities, database design inadequacies, incorrect code written by users, or other factors outside of Varigence's control, such as overly-broad "how to" requests.

Varigence will advise when technical support issues are determined as such and will assist, within reason, in guiding customers to potential resolutions or external documentation for self-guided troubleshooting and cease further support efforts.

This policy ensures that Varigence can focus its resources on providing technical assistance to customers who are experiencing genuine software or functionality issues.  
 

# Bug Fix Policy  

The Varigence bug fix policy is based on an internal prioritization system that considers the criticalness of an issue and the number of users potentially affected. Not all reported bugs can or will be fixed due to resource limitations or the assertion that the function is working as intended, despite customer claims to the contrary.

While Varigence makes every effort to address and prioritize reported issues, we cannot guarantee that all issues reported as a bug will be resolved.  
 

# Feature Request Policy

The Varigence feature request policy operates on an internal assessment and prioritization system similar to the bug fix policy (see above). Feature requests consider the potential value of the added feature to our product roadmap and usefulness to the broader user base. Varigence appreciates and values input from our user community, but not all feature requests can be implemented or considered due to resource constraints or misalignments with our strategic application direction.  
 

# User Responsibilities 

To ensure efficient and timely support, users engaging with Varigence Support are expected to adhere to the following guidelines to help facilitate quicker resolutions to their issues.   

*   Initiate contact exclusively through the two approved methods: either via email to [support@varigence.com](mailto:support@varigence.com) or through the Varigence Support portal. Directly contacting team members or company contacts for support-related communications delays established internal processes.
    
*   Export and share metadata exports to review error(s) that originate within a project. Users should ensure that the data shared does not violate any confidentiality agreements or data protection regulations. 
    
*   Provide application details, such as current version and build number, to ensure that Support can reproduce the precise software configuration for tailored assistance.
    
*   Provide a clear and detailed description of encountered issues, including, where appropriate, screenshots, error logs, or other supporting details that can significantly expedite the troubleshooting process. 
    
*   Clarify whether the issue is production-blocking and deemed critical, to prioritize the response and allocate resources more effectively. All Varigence Support tickets are subject to additional internal review and prioritization.
    
*   Be responsive to “cooperative troubleshooting.” In certain cases, Varigence Support may suggest additional troubleshooting steps to be performed on the user’s end, such as attempting reproducible steps, testing different configurations or settings, or providing additional diagnostic data. Prompt and cooperative responses will aid in faster resolution. 
    
*   Adhere to data privacy restrictions by redacting or anonymizing data or metadata prior to sharing any sensitive or confidential information.  
     
    

# Previous Version Support 

Varigence will make reasonable efforts to assist with technical support inquiries related to product versions released less than four (4) years from the date of contact. Users are strongly encouraged to update to the latest version whenever possible. Custom patches may not be available for issues that have since been resolved in more recent versions of the software.

At its sole discretion, Varigence may provide patches and updates for the current and previous major versions of the software in the event of critical issues or vulnerabilities.  
 

# Support Resources

Case submission and management, the community forums, the Knowledge Base library, and extensive software documentation can be found on the Varigence Support Portal located at [support.varigence.com](https://varigence2-my.sharepoint.com/personal/carl_stein_varigence_com/Documents/2023/Operations/Biml%20Partner%20Network/support.varigence.com).

Varigence Support can be contacted by email at [support@varigence.com](mailto:support@varigence.com).  
 

# Support Availability 

Varigence Support maintains comprehensive coverage by assigning support cases to team members in the same time zone, or as close as possible, as the submitting user. This approach guarantees consistent support through overlapping business hours where possible and maximizes response efficiency. Consequently, Varigence Support does not adhere to traditional hours of operation.    
 

# External Support Options 

Varigence understands that some issues may fall outside the scope of our coverage (see "Support Limitations" above) but still require resolution. Varigence Support, upon customer request, may provide referral or contact information for third-party paid development services or a BimlFlex Implementation Partner.  

While we are happy to provide such information, Varigence is not responsible for any work carried out by third-party services and will not be held liable for any issues that arise from such engagements.
