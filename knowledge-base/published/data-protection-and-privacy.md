In May 2018, the European Union (EU) passed the [General Protection Data Regulation](https://gdpr.eu/) (GDPR). The GDPR imposes obligations onto organizations operating globally, so long as they target or collect data related to people in the EU. The GDPR was passed to signal a firm stance on data privacy and security, when more users than ever entrust their personal data to cloud services, and the software services being used to optimize or enhance those cloud service activities. Violations of the privacy and security standards set forth within the GDPR are punishable with penalties reaching into the tens of millions of euros.

Varigence, which operates out of offices in both the United States and Australia, is committed to adhering to the established GDPR security standards for both our customers, and the privacy of the data contained within our customers' data. 

As per the Varigence End User License Agreement (EULA), Varigence affirms:

"No personal information, or other information about our Customers, Users, or data entered into Varigence equipment or systems will be disclosed to third parties. Varigence does collect and use such information for purposes of monitoring compliance with the EULA agreement, analyzing software performance, customer needs, and opportunities to improve Varigence products."

Varigence only collects information from users and customers that is related to newsletter signups, transactional, or required to enforce license compliance.

GDPR compliance requires action from both users as well as companies hosting their data. GDPR compliance can be fortified by pseudonymizing or anonymizing data to reduce risk to data subjects, monitoring servers labelled as containing sensitive information, and providing an auditable trail of changes to any data within one's possession. 

Data warehousing, and data architecture in general, can help any organization begin to better secure their data against breaches, and mitigate any risks associated with data privacy and protection.
