# Issue 

Prior to making a purchase with Varigence, you or your organization needs to know, "how quickly after making a purchase will we receive our product keys?"   
 

# Resolution 

The answer is, simply, it depends. Varigence has flexible options in place to obtain and activate your products as quickly as possible, _depending on your method of purchase._   
  
The options and their product key turnaround time are detailed below.   
  
**Outcome 1: Product Keys are Obtained Immediately, Payment via Credit Card**  
  
Product keys for **any** combination or amount of Varigence products can be obtained immediately after purchase when checking out with a credit card through the [Varigence Store](http://www.varigence.com/store).  
  
**Outcome 2: Product Keys are Obtained Immediately, Payment via Net 30 Invoice**  
  
Product keys can be obtained immediately, when paying via Net 30 Invoice, for the following licensing options: 

*   BimlStudio perpetual license
*   BimlStudio annual subscription
*   BimlFlex annual subscription

Read further below for instructions on how to make payment via Net 30 Invoice.  
  
**Outcome 3: Product Keys Cannot Be Obtained Immediately After Purchase, Payment via Net 30 Invoice**   
  
Product keys **CAN NOT** be obtained immediately, when paying via Net 30 Invoice, for the following licensing options: 

*   BimlStudio monthly subscription
*   BimlFlex monthly subscription

  
If you wish to purchase a **monthly subscription** for BimlFlex or BimlStudio, and obtain your product keys immediately, users will need to complete the transaction with a valid credit card. We apologize for any inconvenience.   
  
The limitation imposed on Net 30 invoices for monthly subscriptions is to avoid any situation where a subscription is used and cancelled prior to payment of the first monthly invoice.   
  
Read further below for instructions on how to make payment via Net 30 Invoice.  
  
**Accepted Payment Options**  
  
The quickest way to make a purchase is through the [Varigence store](http://www.varigence.com/store) and pay with a credit card.  
  
In addition to credit card, Varigence also accepts check, ACH, or bank transfer as valid forms of payment.   
  
**Quote and Invoice Process**  
  
Quotes for a purchase can be generated in two ways.   
  
  
**Method 1: Through the Varigence Store**  
  
When adding products to your cart in the Varigence Store, instead of selecting "Checkout," users can select "Send Quote." A quote on Varigence letterhead will be generated and emailed to the address requested.

When the quote for products is requested, click the link in the generated email and select “Pay By Invoice.” In this instance your product keys will be provided along with the Net 30 Invoice for those same items.  
  
**Method 2: Through Varigence Support**  
  
The second option is to contact [Varigence Sales](mailto:sales@varigence.com) to request a quote.  
  
Sales and Support will assist users with their purchase questions or needs and are able to generate quotes for whatever combination of products or services the user requires.   
  
Users may then share the generated quote with the individual(s) or department(s) at their organization who handle purchase approvals. Approval of the quote may be addressed by way of Purchase Order or written approval within an email to Sales and Support. **A purchase order is not needed if not required by your organization.**  
  
Once support receives acceptance of the quote, the product keys will be generated and shared with the user, along with the invoice which requires payment within thirty (30) days.   
  
**Contact Us**  
  
As always, please do not hesitate to contact [Varigence Support](mailto:support@varigence.com) for any special circumstances, questions, or concerns regarding product key acquisition or payment.
