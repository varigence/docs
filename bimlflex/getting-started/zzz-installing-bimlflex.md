BimlFlex is provided in a single installer. This allows all parts of the framework to be installed and upgraded through a single installation.

The Excel-based metadata editor is a plugin for Microsoft Excel and will be visible as a separate tab in the Excel ribbon when the BimlFlex-enabled Excel workbook is opened from a BimlFlex project.

When installing it is important to match the Excel bitness version. Verify the Excel bitness version before starting the installation and only install the matching version of BimlFlex.

The first time BimlStudio or the BimlFlex Excel file is opened from a BimlFlex project it will ask for a license key. Add a BimlFlex-enabled license key to enable the application. The key is validated online and once validation completes it is possible to run the applications.
