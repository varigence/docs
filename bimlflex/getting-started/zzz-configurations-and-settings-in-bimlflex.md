# Configurations and Settings in BimlFlex

<!-- TODO: Delete or update, covered in the sample configurations now -->

A key feature of BimlFlex is its comprehensive set of configurations and settings.

BimlFlex comes with a set of different default configurations that can be applied to a project

## Detailed Steps

Open the BimlFlex App.

### Review Architecture

The dashboard Actions pane has an option for loading defaults as well as sample metadata.

If the Sample metadata has not been applied, choose to apply either a sample metadata set or a default configuration for the chosen architecture.

### Review Configurations

The Configurations page contains the BimlFlex configurations for core metadata.

Here, metadata columns and data types as well as their default expressions are defined for the data warehouse layers.

While the getting started process uses the default settings, architectural choices such as, if to use End Dating, if to include Deleted and Current Flags, if to include a Row Change Type indicator and how to derive it etc. are all specified in the Configurations sheet.

### Review Settings

Navigate to the Settings page.

The Settings page contains configurable settings such as naming conventions used.

Settings can be overridden when needed. If a setting is not set to enabled, it can be switched on for a specific source object through the settings overrides
