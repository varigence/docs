# Accelerating the Data Vault

The BimlFlex App provides a Graphical Data Vault Accelerator that creates Data Vault objects from the defined source metadata.

Data Vault acceleration is recommended to be performed once the Enterprise Logical Model, the source data model, and the corresponding Data Vault model has been completed.

The Data Vault acceleration uses the source metadata, added modeling metadata, and its defined relationships to create a Raw Data Vault layer. Based on this metadata, BimlFlex can accelerate the required Data Vault structures and the source to target mappings in the metadata repository.

The BimlFlex App provides a graphical accelerator allowing the modeler to create and tweak the required Data Vault model out of the source model.

It is easy and agile to add source objects to the model in iterations.

It is possible to split satellites into multiples and control the naming convention applied

For Links, it is possible to control the Unit of Work grouping.

When the preview matches the model expectations, it is published to the metadata repository.

The new Data Vault objects can be reviewed in the BimlFlex App, in the Data Vault Project, in the Objects page and in the Schema Diagram.

The source objects have Source to Target Column Mappings applied to load the Data Vault. These mappings can be reviewed in the Column Mapping page.
