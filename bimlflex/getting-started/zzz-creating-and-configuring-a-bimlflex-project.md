## Create and configure the BimlFlex project

Create the Metadata Customer through the BimlFlex App and connect the App to this customer. This is created in the BimlFlex database that was created in the installation step previously.

Once the Customer is created the BimlFlex App will connect to it every time it is opened.

Load the starting point sample metadata into the project using the Load Sample Metadata function.

## Create and configure the BimlStudio project

A corresponding BimlFlex project is created through BimlStudio. Connect the project to the Metadata Customer created above.

The project also needs to be configured for the SQL Server version and SSIS deployment method used.

Once the project is configured it is ready to be used for data modeling and Data Warehouse generation.

Restart the BimlStudio application and reopen the project to load the new metadata connection into BimlStudio.
