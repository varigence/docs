## What is BimlFlex

BimlFlex is a collection of templates, metadata definitions, and tooling that enables you to build an end-to-end data solution without ever writing a single line of code.

## Data Modelling

Varigence built BimlFlex with the power of Biml and metadata-driven automation while employing the best and most commonly used modelling philosophies (Kimball, Inmon, Data Vault). BimlFlex was built in collaboration with Biml experts with full transparency at every opportunity.

## Automation + Customization

BimlFlex automation addresses 80-90% of real-world scenarios while giving you the control to customize the last 10-20% with extension points, custom attributes, and the BimlFlex metadata editor.

## Trial

As BimlFlex is a complete tool for building and developing Data Warehouses it is also very comprehensive. The trial process acknowledges this and allows a guided tour through the basic functionality of Building an end to end warehouse. This guided trial allows the creation of a Data Warehouse with the load processes for reading data from a predefined source into a 2 layer Kimball or 3 layer Data Vault architecture.

The trial is geared towards showing the software, its features, functionality and workflow without undue complexity and development effort.

The trial process is supported by detailed documentation and walk-through videos describing every step in he process.

The deliverables from the trial are not designed to be used in a production environment.

## Proof Of Concept

Should there be a need to test a specific technical feature or function as part of a procurement process or requirements analysis it is possible to engage Varigence or a Varigence BimlFlex consulting partner in a Proof Of Concept (PoC) implementation. This allows the well defined concept to be tested.

The PoC has a clearly defined success criteria and scope to allow the implementation to conclude successfully.

The deliverables from a PoC are not designed to be used in a production environment.

## Pilot

A pilot project is an initial implementation that allows the Data Warehousing team to quickly ramp up a BimlFlex implementation and deliver business value. The pilot will use customer environments and data and deliver a project with limited scope that shows that the BimlFlex workflow and approach works in a customer environment. This can be used to create a reference implementation or to validate the architecture, approach or design principles for the Data Warehousing.

Varigence or a Varigence BimlFlex consulting partner are available for a pilot implementation. The scope of the implementation is defined in collaboration with the Data Warehousing stakeholders

The deliverables from a pilot project are designed to be used in a production environment.
