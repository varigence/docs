# BimlFlex for Azure Mapping Data Flows

One of the advantages of using Mapping Data Flows, aside from the visual representation of the data logistics, is the ability to use inline Sources and Sinks (targets). Inline datasets allow direct access to many types of data sources without a dedicated connector object (dataset). They are especially useful when the underlying structure may evolve.

Also, and especially in data lake scenarios, they offer a way to manage where the compute takes place without requiring additional compute clusters.
