# Release Notes

Varigence is excited to release the November 2024 version of the BimlFlex platform for data solution automation!

> [!NOTE]
>
> - This is a major release and we recommend testing in a non-production environment before upgrading your production environment.
> - Please make sure databases and projects are backed up before upgrading.
> - Please email support@bimlflex.com with any installation or upgrade issues.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **New Naming Convention for Release Notes**
>
> Varigence has implemented a new naming convention for all upcoming release notes. The first release of each new year will be named after the year alone (e.g., the first release of 2025 will be titled "BimlFlex 2025"). Subsequent releases within the same year will be named after the year and the month of the release.
> This current release, which would have been called "BimlFlex 2024 R3" under the previous naming convention, will be named "BimlFlex November 2024."
> This naming convention is designed to better communicate the timing of releases and to align with naming of other popular applications with multiple releases per year.
> Users can verify their version number within the application to determine the corresponding release notes.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> 
>**Important Update for BimlFlex 2024 Upgrade**
>
> When upgrading to BimlFlex 2024, it is mandatory to also upgrade the BimlCatalog across all of your environments. This update introduces the SourceScopedName and TargetScopedName parameters, enhancing runtime debugging capabilities, particularly within Azure Data Factory with limitations related to pipeline name lengths.
>
> **Action Required**: All SSIS packages and ADF pipelines must be redeployed following the upgrade. This step is crucial for ensuring compatibility and taking full advantage of the new features.
