# Modeling Tools Overview

The Modeling Tools provides graphical tools for users to accomplish a range of data modeling tasks in an intuitive interface.

Each tool provides views and actions that make sense in the context of the specific tool.

## Data Vault Accelerator

The Data Vault Accelerator provides a quick-start opportunity with a best effort, technical modeling of Data Vault constructs out of the source metadata. It is configurable and provides a preview that can be rerun as many times as necessary so that the initial Data Vault modeling can be completed faster than through manual metadata modeling.

## Schema Diagram

The Schema Diagram provides an entity relation view of any set of metadata based on the integration stage. It allows a user to get an overview of what the metadata looks like in an easy to understand view. It also helps the developer to execute the most common actions on the data in a graphical interface.

## Column Mapping

The Column Mapping Diagram provides an view of one or more mapping relationships. It allows a user to get a quick view of mappings in a graphical interface. It allows the developer to easily add or remove mappings using column drag and drop. It also provides some of the most common actions that make sense in the context of data mapping.

## Business Modeling

The Business Modeling provides an interface for a team of business representatives working in conjunction with technical team members (IT, data analysts, or consultants) to detail the primary aspects of a business' interactions, objectives, and relationships. The Business model serves as the basis for Data Vault modeling.
