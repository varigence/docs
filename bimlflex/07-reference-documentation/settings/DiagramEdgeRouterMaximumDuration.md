# EdgeRouter Max Duration (ms)

Determines the maximum amount of time that the edge router should run before stopping. Longer run times will degrade performance but improve layout quality. This timing is not guaranteed, but the routing algorithm will attempt to stay below the limit while producing valid output.

Notes:

* This setting is part of the *Diagrams* settings category.
* The default value for this setting is `5000`.
