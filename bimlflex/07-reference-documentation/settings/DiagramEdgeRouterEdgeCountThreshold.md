# EdgeRouter Edge Count Threshold

Determines the maximum number of edges before edge routing is completely disabled in a diagram. This will result in edges being straight lines that may overlap other nodes. For very large diagrams, this is necessary to prevent the application from hanging.

Notes:

* This setting is part of the *Diagrams* settings category.
* The default value for this setting is `500`.
