# Insert Script With Table

When enabled, this setting ensures that the default insert script is retained and bundled together with the `CREATE TABLE` file. This is useful if you wish to keep the initial data insertion logic intact alongside the table structure.

Notes:

* This setting is part of the *Data Vault* settings category.
* The default value for this setting is `N`.
