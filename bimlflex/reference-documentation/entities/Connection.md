# Connections

The BimlFlex [Connections](configuration editor) provide the information required to connect to data sources. Connections are also used as containers for objects and allow setting overrides. Additionally, Connections contain metadata to identify the integration stage along with data logistics execution settings.

## Overview
  
| Property | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
|Name | The name of the Connection. This must be unique for the selected Customer.|
|ConnectionString | Connection string to be used by this connection to access the data. Please note that this connection string will be parsed at build time (in BimlStudio) if the underlying platform requires testing for object existence (e.g. using SSIS). For Cloud Connections, this connectin string is only used to import and update design metadata. A separate runtime connection for Cloud Connections is specified in BimlFlex under the Linked Service.|
|Catalog | The database name that the connection points to. For an Excel file connection this will be the worksheet name. If you work in an environment where the production database is named differently to other environments, it is recommended using the production name. For example, using AdventureWorks (Production) instead of AdventureWorks_DEV (Development).|
|RecordSource | A name or abbreviation that uniquely identifies the source of the data. This is a mandatory field for Connections with an Integration Stage of Source System. The Record Source is defined as an Ansi String of lentgh 10 data type by default, but this can be changed to any value in the Configurations screen. BimlFlex will notify the user if a length is entered that exceeds that of the defined datatype in the Configuration. The Record Source value is used throughout the BimlFlex implementation as additional data points and to support auditability. It also is used within conventions such as creation of schema- and table names. Because of this, it is often easiest to use an abbreviation and adhere to standard database object naming - e.g. no spaces and commas.|
|FilePath | The path where the files are located, in the case of a File Connection. The Biml templates will use this attribute in a &lt;ForEachFileLoop&gt; to load all files in this path / directory and that match the File Pattern.|
|FilePattern | The pattern, or wildcard, that can be used to identify which files will be loaded in the case of a File Connection. For example *.csv.|
|PersistHistory | For a Connection with the Integration Stage of Source System, this setting manages history tracking in the Persistent Staging Area (PSA) corresponding to the Connection. This requires a Persistent Staging Connection to be defined in the Project that uses the Source Connection. If this setting is disabled (but a PSA connection is configured), the PSA database only maintains the most recent change (state). This way, the PSA becomes an Operational Data Store (ODS) containing only the most recently received data but no history. Having a current-state only PSA can be useful to provide as an ODS, and can be delivered quickly using the source metadata.|
|UseTemporalTables | |
|NoOfThreads | The number of threads a data logistics process can use to split the workload at runtime using the selected connection. The default is 1. The amount of threads can be redefined at the object level. When using SSIS, this attribute is only used in the SRC â€“ STG template with the Balance Data Distributor to allow for greater parallelism. Only define a value greater than zero if the server has enough CPU and Memory to accommodate additional threads.|
|ExcludeFromModel | |
|DataSource | Name of the server the Connection points to. This is usually omitted as a separate configuration because defining this in the Connection String is sufficient.|
|AuthenticationMethod | Indicator which Authentication Method will be used for the selected Connection.|
|UserName | The user name which is to be used in the Connection, in case Authentication Method (Named User) is selected.|
|Password | The password which is to be used in the Connection, in case Authentication Method (Named User) is selected.|
|Provider | The type of connection provider used for this connection. When using ADO.NET connections other than SQL Server this is a required field.|
