# Objects

[`Objects`](xref:objects) in BimlFlex are the data stores that can be used as source or target for data logistics. An Object can be a database table, a flat file, Excel documents, and, via use of [`Extensions Points`](xref:bimlflex-concepts-extension-points), APIs calls.  Instead of using multiple entity types to handle these scenarios BimlFlex uses managed metadata and the *Object Type* field to annotate what type of **Object** is being referenced.

## Overview
  
| Property | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
|`Schema` | The Database Schema the Object belongs to.|
|`Name` | Name of the Object (e.g. table or view). The BimlFlex recommended practice is to use CamelCase as a naming convention. During the import of source metadata BimlFlex provides options to convert the name with underscores to CamelCase, or using various other conventions.|
|`IsNotPersistent` | |
|`ExcludeFromBuild` | |
|`ExcludeFromModel` | |
|`ExcludeFromValidation` | |
|`SourceCreateSql` | Specify a SQL statement that can be used to override the creation, or definition, of an Object when it is a source - an Object that is selected from. For example, this can be used to deploy a view onto the source database to represent the Object or to add SQL to a CI\CD pipeline. This must be a complete SQL statement.|
|`CreateSql` | Specify a SQL statement that can be used to override the creation, or definition, of a target Object. By default, target Objects are generated by BimlFlex but the way these are created can be overridden here for each Object individually. This must be a complete SQL statement.|
|`OverrideSql` | Overrides the complete SQL statement used to query the Object. This must be a complete SQL statemement. Adding an override here disregards any other SQL overrides, such as FROM SQL or WHERE SQL.|
|`FromSql` | Override the FROM clause of the generated SQL statement that is used to query the Object. This snippet must start with the FROM keyword. This can be used to customize the query behaviour. If using an Object Alias this must be included in the SQL statement. For example FROM @@this source WITH (NOLOCK).|
|`JoinSql` | |
|`WhereSql` | |
|`ObjectAlias` | |
|`SelectBySql` | |
|`GroupBySql` | |
|`OrderBySql` | |
|`BusinessName` | |
|`BusinessShortName` | |
|`BusinessGrouping` | |
|`SameAsInherited` | |
|`UseInheritedName` | |
|`IsColumnNamesInFirstDataRow` | |
|`FlatFileType` | |
|`DataRowsToSkip` | |
|`TextQualifer` | |
|`RowDelimiter` | |
|`ColumnDelimiter` | |
|`LastColumnDelimiter` | |
|`CodePage` | |
|`IsUnicode` | |
|`EscapeCharacter` | |
|`NullValue` | |
|`FriendlyName` | |
|`Description` | |
|`Comments` | |
|`UseOwnThread` | |
|`NoOfThreads` | |

## References
  
| Property | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
|`ProjectUID` | The Project the Object belongs to. If you would like the Object to be referenced by additional Projects, you can use the InheritFromObject, SameAsInherited and UseInheritedName attributes. This is useful when an Object is used in an incremental load during the day and should be part of a full load during the end of day (month) process.|
|`ConnectionUID` | Every Object is referenced through a Connection, which is set in this field.|
|`CustomerUID` | Reference to the Customer that this Object belongs to.|
|`VersionUID` | Reference to the Version that this Object belongs to.|
|`ObjectTypeId` | A classification on the Object, to identify the role to play in the data processing. The Object Type is used to select the code generation to apply at Object level.|
|`CompressionTypeId` | |
|`PartitionSchemeId` | |
|`AcceleratorTypeId` | |
|`InheritFromObjectUID` | |
|`DependOnObjectUID` | |
|`BusinessEntityUID` | |
