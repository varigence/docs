# Objects



## Overview
  
| Property | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
|`Schema` | The Database Schema the Object belongs to.|
|`Name` | Name of the Object (e.g. table or view). The BimlFlex recommended practice is to use CamelCase as a naming convention. During the import of source metadata BimlFlex provides options to convert the name with underscores to CamelCase, or using various other conventions.|
|`IsNotPersistent` | |
|`ExcludeFromBuild` | |
|`ExcludeFromModel` | |
|`ExcludeFromValidation` | |
|`SourceCreateSql` | Specify a SQL statement that can be used to override the creation, or definition, of an Object when it is a source - an Object that is selected from. For example, this can be used to deploy a view onto the source database to represent the Object or to add SQL to a CI\CD pipeline. This must be a complete SQL statement.|
|`CreateSql` | Specify a SQL statement that can be used to override the creation, or definition, of a target Object. By default, target Objects are generated by BimlFlex but the way these are created can be overridden here for each Object individually. This must be a complete SQL statement.|
|`OverrideSql` | Overrides the complete SQL statement used to query the Object. This must be a complete SQL statemement. Adding an override here disregards any other SQL overrides, such as FROM SQL or WHERE SQL.|
|`FromSql` | Override the FROM clause of the generated SQL statement that is used to query the Object. This snippet must start with the FROM keyword. This can be used to customize the query behaviour. If using an Object Alias this must be included in the SQL statement. For example FROM @@this source WITH (NOLOCK).|
