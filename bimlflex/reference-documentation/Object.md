# Objects

[`Objects`](xref:objects) in BimlFlex are the data stores that can be used as source or target for data logistics. An Object can be a database table, a flat file, Excel documents, and, via use of [`Extensions Points`](xref:bimlflex-concepts-extension-points), APIs calls.  Instead of using multiple entity types to handle these scenarios BimlFlex uses managed metadata and the *Object Type* field to annotate what type of **Object** is being referenced.

## Overview
  
| Property | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
|`Schema` | The Database Schema the Object belongs to.|
|`Name` | Name of the Object (e.g. table or view). The BimlFlex recommended practice is to use CamelCase as a naming convention. During the import of source metadata BimlFlex provides options to convert the name with underscores to CamelCase, or using various other conventions.|
|`IsNotPersistent` | Defines an override that applies to an Object for a Connection, that applies to the behaviour in the Persistent Staging Area (PSA). When enabled, the Object will not be stored in the PSA. In other words, setting this override to `Y` will exclude the column from being persisted.|
|`ExcludeFromBuild` | Entering Y into this column will determine if this object will be built along with the rest of the solution when the BimlFlex solution is being compiled.|
|`ExcludeFromModel` | Entering Y into this column will determine if this object''s metadata will be excluded along with the rest of the BimlFlex solution.|
|`ExcludeFromValidation` | Entering Y into this column will determine if this object''s metadata will be validated along with the rest of the BimlFlex solution.|
|`SourceCreateSql` | Specify a SQL statement that can be used to override the creation, or definition, of an Object when it is a source - an Object that is selected from. For example, this can be used to deploy a view onto the source database to represent the Object or to add SQL to a CI\CD pipeline. This must be a complete SQL statement.|
|`CreateSql` | Specify a SQL statement that can be used to override the creation, or definition, of a target Object. By default, target Objects are generated by BimlFlex but the way these are created can be overridden here for each Object individually. This must be a complete SQL statement.|
|`OverrideSql` | Overrides the complete SQL statement used to query the Object. This must be a complete SQL statemement. Adding an override here disregards any other SQL overrides, such as FROM SQL or WHERE SQL.|
|`FromSql` | Override the FROM clause of the generated SQL statement that is used to query the Object. This snippet must start with the FROM keyword. This can be used to customize the query behaviour. If using an Object Alias this must be included in the SQL statement. For example FROM @@this source WITH (NOLOCK).|
|`JoinSql` | If the source select requires a JOIN this is where it can be entered. Example: `INNER JOIN [SalesLT].[CustomerAddress] ca ON src.[AddressID] = ca.[AddressID] AND ca.[AddressType] = ''Main Office''` The query is limited to 1000 characters.|
|`WhereSql` | If the source select requires a WHERE clause this is where it can be entered. Note that defining a Parameter on the object will be appended to the statement. Example: `WHERE [Culture] = ''en''`|
|`ObjectAlias` | Defines an alias (short name) for the Object. This is relevant in conjunction with the `JoinSql` and/or `WhereSql` attributes. Generally `src` is used as a default|
|`SelectBySql` | If the source select requires a `DISTINCT` or `TOP N` clause this is where it can be entered. The field is limited to 1000 characters.|
|`GroupBySql` | If the source select requires a `GROUP BY` clause this is where it can be entered. The field is limited to 1000 characters.|
|`OrderBySql` | If the source select requires an `ORDER BY` clause this is where it can be entered. The field is limited to 1000 characters.|
|`BusinessName` | This column contains the actual table name users want the object to appear as after the solution is deployed. This is better described with and example. Letâ€™s say you have a source system with cryptic names like GL002 and the actual business name is GeneralLedger. By defining a value and generating a Data Vault using the BimlFlex Accelerator the result would be [HUB_GeneralLedger], [SAT_GeneralLedger]|
|`BusinessShortName` | This column contains the short table name users want the object to appear as after the solution is deployed. As per the `BusinessName`, but is used in naming Links and Link Satellites. As an example if there is a link between the `GeneralLedger` and `ChartOfAccounts` the name will be `[LNK_GeneralLedger_ChartOfAccounts]`. Defining values here the name could be `[LNK_GL_COA]`, providing flexibility when modelling.|
|`BusinessGrouping` | This column categories objects per subject area. This grouping can be used in the Data Vault Accelerator for constrained acceleration.|
|`SameAsInherited` | Defines if the InheritFromObject is the same object. Entering Y into this column will instruct BimlFLex to reuse the inherited tables for loading.|
|`UseInheritedName` | Defines if the InheritFromObject has the same object. Entering Y into this column will instruct BimlFLex to reuse the inherited tables ObjectName for loading.|
|`IsColumnNamesInFirstDataRow` | This value specifies whether more descriptive column names are provided in the first data row to replace the column names specified in the Flat File Format Columns collection.|
|`FlatFileType` | The FlatFileType provides options for the type of flat file row format that will be used.|
|`DataRowsToSkip` | This value specifies how many data rows to skip before beginning to product data.|
|`TextQualifer` | This value specifies which character is used to identify contiguous blocks of text in a flat file. Column delimiters within blocks of contiguous text will be ignored and treated as text data.|
|`RowDelimiter` | This value specifies the delimiter to use to segregate rows.|
|`ColumnDelimiter` | This value specifies the delimiter string that will be used to mark the end of this column.|
|`LastColumnDelimiter` | This value specifies the delimiter to use for column header rows.|
|`CodePage` | This value specifies the code page to use for character and string manipulation of non-Unicode text.|
|`IsUnicode` | This value specifies whether Unicode character and string manipulation will be used.|
|`EscapeCharacter` | This value specifies the Dataset Escape character to use.|
|`NullValue` | This value specifies the Dataset Null value to use.|
|`FriendlyName` | Business Friendly name of object.|
|`Description` | The object described in business context. Often referred to as business metadata.|
|`Comments` | Generic comments for use by the Analyst and Modelers to keep notes related to the object|
|`UseOwnThread` | Objects will be executed within the Batch based on Topological sort order and then alphabetical. If you would like the object to be executed in its own thread at the start of the respective execution container set this attribute to `true`|
|`NoOfThreads` | At the object level, this is where we can define the amount of threads that we want the load to be distributed across in the SSIS package.|

## References
  
| Property | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
|`ProjectUID` | The Project the Object belongs to. If you would like the Object to be referenced by additional Projects, you can use the InheritFromObject, SameAsInherited and UseInheritedName attributes. This is useful when an Object is used in an incremental load during the day and should be part of a full load during the end of day (month) process.|
|`ConnectionUID` | Every Object is referenced through a Connection, which is set in this field.|
|`CustomerUID` | Reference to the Customer that this Object belongs to.|
|`VersionUID` | Reference to the Version that this Object belongs to.|
|`ObjectTypeId` | A classification on the Object, to identify the role to play in the data processing. The Object Type is used to select the code generation to apply at Object level.|
|`CompressionTypeId` | |
|`PartitionSchemeId` | |
|`BusinessEntityUID` | |
|`AcceleratorTypeId` | This column is used to define which model object this object is defined to be. For instance if this object is defining a HUB LINK or SAT this is where we can make this distinction. The framework will interpret the type when importing metadata from source and can be overridden after additional analysis. Please note that this attribute is only relevant when using BimlFlex to generate a Raw Data Vault model.|
|`InheritFromObjectUID` | This column contains a reference to the object that column metadata should inherited from unless it has its own column metadata. This object will use the inferred from object name in the source query.|
|`DependOnObjectUID` | This column contains a dependency reference to the object that defines the precedence for execution solve order.|
