# Display Schema Name

Determines whether the Schema name is included in Data Mart object names.

<br><br>This setting affects the name of the object as it is shown in the logical view in Bimlstudio (the expanded model). This is related to the "Append Schema" setting in the Data Mart setting group.

<br><br>By using this setting the objects are created as separate entities because of their schema name (uniquefied).

Notes:

* This setting is part of the `Data Mart` settings category.
* The default value for this setting is `N`.
