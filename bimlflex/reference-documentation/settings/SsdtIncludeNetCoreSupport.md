# Include .NET Core Project Support

Determines whether SSDT Project files and build script files are created with .NET Core support.

This allows opening the SSDT project in Azure Data Studio using the Microsoft SQL Server Database Projects extension.

This also creates separate build files that use the dotnet.exe build engine for the SSDT build

Notes:

* This setting is part of the `SSDT` settings category.
* The default value for this setting is `N`.
