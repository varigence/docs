# Metadata Repository

BimlFlex metadata is managed through the robust Varigence BimlFlex Excel Add-in and is persisted in a metadata database.

For the BimlFlex framework, the modeling focus on technical metadata. Technical metadata represents information that describes how to access the data and includes data type, the name of the data in the enterprise information system, and other information that describes the way the native enterprise information system identifies the meta object.

## Metadata Model

Predefined Extensible Model designed to create complex metadata models and data mapping scenarios. The model describes the schema that will be used to store the metadata.

## Metadata Instance

* Instances store metadata in the format described in the BimlFlex model.
* Allows easy access to the metadata during development.
* More useful in this format than raw metadata (e.g. in an Excel file)
* The properties are more accessible than using annotations.
* It's much faster to develop and to build.

## Metadata Entities

A metadata model describes what will be used to store the metadata that is subsequently authored by end users. It can be thought of as a database schema and provides the ability to create a general purpose Entity/Relationship model.
Below is an outline of the properties and relationships for each entity type.

### Versions Entity

Provide selected Customer and Version details to metadata instance

#### Properties

| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| CustomerUID | Selected Customer Guid |
| Customer | Selected Customer Name |
| VersionUID | Selected Version Guid |
| IsCurrent | Flag that defines if the Version is current. Only current Versions are visible in the Versions Drop Down |
| Comments | Optional Comments |
| DatabaseVersion | Current version of the BimlFlex database. |

### Connections Entity

Configure connection attributes for both Databases and Files. The ConnectionType attribute allows you to define any of the supported types however some may require Extension Point overrides.

#### Properties

| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| ConnectionString | Connection string to be used for this connection. Please note that the ConnectionString will only be parsed by BimlStudio when you build the solution or manually test it. |
| Catalog | Database name that the connection points to. When defining an Excel file this will be the worksheet name. If you have an environment where the production database is named differently to other environments we recommend using the production name. Example: AdventureWorks (Production) vs AdventureWorks_DEV (Development) |
| PersistHistory | Determines whether to track history when defining a connection with an IntegrationStage = "PSA" for Persistent Staging Area. If this is not set and a PSA connection is configured then the database becomes a ODS without history. This is very useful to create an ODS by merely importing the source metadata. |
| Server | Name of the host server the connection points to. Generally this is omitted as defining it in the ConnectionString is sufficient.  |
| Provider | Defined the type of connection provider used in this connection. When using ADO.NET connections other than MSSQL this is a required field. |
| RecordSource | Abbreviation to uniquely identify the source system. This attribute is compulsory for all defined IntegrationStage = "SRC"(source). Required attribute for modeling Data Vault in particular.  |
| StartDelimiter | Derived value from [meta].[SystemType] table. The column starting delimiter used by the DBMS when performing a query. |
| EndDelimiter | Derived value from [meta].[SystemType] table. The column ending delimiter used by the DBMS when performing a query. |
| IgnoreSchema | Derived value from [meta].[SystemType] table. If this is set to "Y" then the source query will omit the schema. |

| ConnectionType | Defines the connections type. This list will mirror the different types of connections that can be defined in Biml. Below is a list of the current possible ConnectionTypes. The list should be extended to include PDW. |
| IntegrationStage | Defines the connections data warehouse layer or stage. This is an important attribute as it is used to determine what template get applied to its related objects. An example would be that the relevant source to staging Biml template will search for objects that relates to a connection with an IntegrationStage set to "SRC". The [meta].[IntegrationStage] table is an internal framework type (enum) and should be changed or added too only in consultation with Varigence. Below is a list of the current possible IntegrationStages. |
| FilePattern | If this is a file connection, this value is the pattern of applicable files in file path e.g. "*.csv" |
| FilePath | If this is a file connection, this path of the source file. The Biml template will use this attribute in a <ForEachFileLoop> to load all files that match the FilePattern. |
| NoOfThreads | The default number of threads that SSIS can use to split the load when loading data when this connection is used. The amount of threads can be redefined at the object level. Currently this attribute is only used in the SRC â€“ STG template along with the Balance Data Distributor to allow greater parallelism. Only define a value greater than zero if the Server has enough CPU and Memory to accommodate additional threads. |
| ExcludeFromModel | Entering Y into this column will determine if the objects associated with this connection's metadata will be excluded along with the rest of the BimlFlex solution. |
| Description | Optional metadata to provide description. |
| ConnectionUID | The GUID for the Connection from BimlFlex database used to provide the package id. |

#### Properties

| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Schema | Schema to which this object belongs or is meant to belong, is set in this field. |
| ObjectName | Name of Object (Table, View). Best practice is to use CamelCase. During the import of source metadata we provide options to convert name with under_scores to CamelCase and vice versa. |
| ObjectType | This field is used to setup object type. This field refers to ObjectTypes enumerator. Below is a list of the current possible Object Types. |
| ModelObjectType | This column is used to define which model object this object is defined to be. For instance if this object is defining a HUB LINK or SAT this is where we can make this distinction. The framework will interpret the type when importing metadata from source and can be overridden after additional analysis. Please note that this attribute is only relevant when using BimlFlex to generate a Raw Data Vault model. |
| IsNotPersistent | Defines an Override to the Persistent Staging Connection defined as part of the Project Entity. A good example of usage would be where the source system audits changes effectively and/or the source object size discourage persistence. Note that setting it to "Y" will exclude the object from being persisted. |

By defining a value and generating a Data Vault using the BimlFlex Accelerator the result would be [HUB_GeneralLedger], [SAT_GeneralLedger] |
| ModelOverrideShortName | This column contains the short table name users want the object to appear as after the solution is deployed. As per the `ModelOverrideName`, but is used in naming Links and Link Satellites. As an example if there is a link between the `GeneralLedger` and `ChartOfAccounts` the name will be `[LNK_GeneralLedger_ChartOfAccounts]`. Defining values here the name could be `[LNK_GL_COA]`, providing flexibility when modeling. |
| InheritFromObject | This column contains a reference to the object that column metadata should inherited from unless it has its own column metadata. This object will use the inferred from object name in the source query. |
| SameAsInherited | Defines if the InheritFromObject is the same object. Entering Y into this column will instruct BimlFLex to reuse the inherited tables for loading. |
| UseInheritedName | Defines if the InheritFromObject has the same object. Entering Y into this column will instruct BimlFLex to reuse the inherited tables ObjectName for loading. |

| ModelOverrideName | This column contains the business column name users want the object to appear as after the solution is deployed. This is better described with and example. Let's say you have a source system with cryptic names like GL002 and the actual business name is GeneralLedgerCode. By defining a value and generating a Data Vault using the BimlFlex Accelerator the resulting column will be [GeneralLedgerCode] |
| DataTypeMapping | xxxxx |
| ModelGrouping | This attribute is used to group columns into their own satellites. Example would be if you have a customer table that has a column "LastLoginDate" that changes very frequently you might want to model this in a separate satellite. All columns with the same ModelGrouping will be generated into separate satellites. It is also used to define a Unit Of Work on Links |

| IsIdentity | "Y" if this column is the identity column of the object |
| IsNullable | "Y" if this column is the allow NULL (empty) values |
| IsDerived | "Y" if the value in this column is derived during the ETL process. This is generally set in conjunction with the `SsisDataflowExpression` attribute. |
| IsNotPersistent | Defines an Override to the Persistent Staging Connection defined as part of the Project Entity. A good example of usage would be where derived columns should not be persisted. Note that setting it to "Y" will exclude the column from being persisted. |
| ExcludeFromModel | Entering Y into this column will determine if this column will be built along with the rest of the solution when the BimlFlex solution is being compiled.  |

The placeholder "@@this" is replaced with the parameter name and inserted into the SQL aggregation. <br/>Eg: `MAX(@@this)` and `CONVERT(VARCHAR(19), MAX(@@this), 120)` for dates.<br/>                                 |
| ParameterToName | This attribute specify the name of the parameter being used in the package. Use this attribute to define a from and to variable on a column. |
| ParameterToOperator | This attribute define an operator to be used in combination with ParameterToName |
| ExecuteSqlOnSource | Specify if the `ParameterSql` should be executed on the source connection to retrieve the next load value. |
| ParameterColumnExpression | In this column, we can define an override to be used instead of the ColumnName. Sometimes we need to use a column that was joined from another table to determine change like the LastModifiedDate. Normally this table join will use an<br/>alias and we can then override the WHERE clause here. EG. e.[LastModifiedDate] or e.@@this.<br/>                                 |
