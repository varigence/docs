# Metadata and framework settings

This document outlines the metadata and framework settings available in BimlFlex.

These settings drive the behavior of the BimlFlex product.

By changing settings, the produced artifacts can adapt to specific requirements for file locations, naming conventions, data conventions etc.

Align these settings with the organizations best practices and environmental requirements.
