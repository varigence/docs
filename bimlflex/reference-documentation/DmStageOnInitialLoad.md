# Stage On Initial Load

Should the Data Mart stage process run on initial load.

Disable this to not stage on initial load.

Any post process code that use the staging table contents will need to take this into consideration

Notes:
* This setting is part of the `Data Mart` settings category.
 * The default value for this setting is `N`.
