# BimlFlex Reference Documentation

The BimlFlex Reference Documentation contains detailed information about the many ways BimlFlex can be configured.

## Extension Point Definitions

The BimlFlex Extension Point Definitions contains reference documentation about the available Extension Points.

Extension points are one of the key features BimlFlex provides customization to cater for specific scenarios. While the standard templates cover most real-world scenarios, there may be a specific tweak that would improve certain specific requirements. These modifications can be defined using Extension Points, that allow for custom logic to be added to a template at various points in the process.

## App Metadata Definitions

This section covers the details on the structure of the BimlFlex App and metadata, for example the overview of all the BimlFlex screens and controls. These are sometimes referred to as Metadata Entities, because they correspond to the structures and classes used in the metadata object model.
