# Driving Keys in Data Vault

A **Driving Key** is a **Unique Key** on a Link that is used to determine the effectivity of a relationship or series of relationships.
This is commonly used when a relationship is tracked by a Business Concept itself, not by individual expiry records on the Link Satellite.
Driving Keys are used to enforce a many-to-one relationship on the otherwise many-to-many construct of a Link.
A Driving Key is used track when a relationship changes, and which side of the relationship *determines* the change.

## Driving Key Observability

From a modelling perspective, Driving Keys are a qualifier on an existing Key, not a new construct.
Commonly, the Business Key of the driving Business Concept, or source key, is persisted as a degenerate field on the Link itself.
Driving Keys do not change a model.
Driving Keys indicate how ELT/ETL should be performed, and how a relationship is maintained.

## Relationships in a Data Vault

A core tenet of Data Vault modelling methodology is to track *business relationships* in a **Link**.
A Link is made up of a unique set of business keys referencing *business concepts* represented by **Hubs**.
One of the more challenging elements is tracking relationship effectivity and which part of the key determines or drive a new instance of the relationship.

For simplicity of explanation, we focus on modelling and capturing Link effectivity and not the pros and cons of inserts versus updates, or using Link Satellites at all.

<!--
A core tenet of Data Vault modelling methodology is to track relationships in a Link and to be modeled as a many-to-many relationship.
Effectivity is then tracked in a Satellite based on the observation of when a unique interaction of Business Concepts are observed.
When a relationship is observed for the first time it is created and marked as active based on the date it was observed.
When a relationship is terminated similar logic is used and the relationship is terminated based on the date of the observed termination.
By nature these exist exclusively with no relation to any other observed relationship.
A Driving Key is required when a relationship should be tracked, observed and terminated based around a central Business Concept and not simply the relationship itself.
Effectivity is then started and ended based on when a Business Concept was first observed and when a relationship change occurs on the driving Business Concept.
-->

### Tracking by Historical Relationship

A common Data Vault practice is to create a Satellite on the Link (LSAT) which contains history specific to the Link.
This allows one to track specific historical changes to a relationship.
Using an LSAT allows maintaining historical data where end-dated relationships may need to be reopened or reactivated without fear of losing any data.

**For example:** Imagine the operation of a tavern.
The tavern opens for business on August 10, 2020.
A tavern will store kegs of different varieties of beer and distribute through a tap system hooked up to the bar.

>[!NOTE]
> In this article's examples, Link Keys have been simplified in order to shift focus on Driving Key behaviors.

This tavern has five (5) varieties of beer: Pale Ale, Stout, Lager, IPA, and Cider.
There is only one (1) tap for distribution.
This setup demonstrates a one-to-many relationship.
There is one tap and many beers.
The *type* of beer available on tap is, essentially, inconsequential.
At any time only one (1) beer is going to be available despite there being five (5) different options.

![One-to-Many Link Relationship](images/beer-link-one-to-many.png "One to Many Link Relationship")

One month later on September 10, 2020, the tavern installs a second tap.
Now there are two (2) possible options for available beer.
The Hub for Taps can be edited to include a second tap without issue.
This addition does not change the architecture of the model, but now there are two (2) one-to-many relationships.

![Two (2) One-to-Many Relationships](images/beer-link-one-to-many-2.0.png "Two (2) One-to-Many Link Relationships")

<!--
A many-to-many relationship would show multiple relationships between Taps (*a possible two (2)*) and Beers (*a possible five (5)*).

![Many-to-Many Link Relationship](images/many-to-many-link-relationship-1.png "Many-to-Many Link Relationship")

An additional example of a many-to-many relationship would be a single tap having multiple active records for various beers that can also be active on other taps.
This may be done when tracking status for a empty keg and an active record for the current beer being served.
-->

### Tracking by Driving Key

In this example, the Taps entity is defined as "driving," meaning that ETL enforces the logic that a single Tap cannot be associated with multiple beers at any time.

>[!NOTE]
> Hub Taps and Hub Beer do not change for the remainder of this example, and are excluded from the below examples.

Continuing with the same example, historical tracking through a Link Satellite would look like such:

![Link Satellite Historical Tracking](images/historical-tracking-lsat.png "Link Satellite Historical Tracking")

<!--
"Zero Records" are optional records which indicate the first recognized interaction with a Driving Key.
The paramount indicator for a zero record is an interaction with a Driving Key, not when a record first enters the system.
In this instance our Driving Keys are the Taps, and zero records would appear as such:
![Zero Records](/bimlflex/concepts/images/zero-records-last.png "Zero Records")
-->

After enough pints sold a keg will be kicked (emptied).
A new beer will then replace the now-empty beer.
Data Vault tracks historical data so the record for the kicked beer will be end-dated and a new record will be created for the new relationship.

The Pale Ale on Tap #1 was kicked on October 10, 2020. It was replaced the following day with the Cider.

The changes to inventory would appear as such in the Link and Link Satellite:

![Link Satellite](images/link-sat-01a.png "Link Satellite")

The record for Beer on Tap #1 expired on October 10, 2020, the date the keg kicked.
A new record was created to mark the termination on October 10, 2020, noting the status as "empty."

Next, a new record will be created, and activated, to mark that a new Beer is now hooked up to Tap #1, with the status noted as "full."

![Link Satellite 2](images/link-sat-02a.png "Link Satellite 2")

The two active relationships at this point in time, October 11, 2020, are Beer on Tap #1 and the separate Beer on Tap #2.

![Link Satellite 3](images/link-sat-03a.png "Link Satellite 3")

The final model for this architecture would look as such:

## BimlFlex Handling of Driving Keys

BimlFlex is optimized to recognize Driving Keys automatically. The Accelerator allows the framework to automatically apply Driving Key type relationships for any Links derived out of a Hub and be included in the load logic. Alternatively, users may manually define Driving Keys through simple settings.
The simple process for both implied creation and manual creation of Driving Keys within BimlFlex are detailed below.

### Implied Creation of Driving Keys

> [!NOTE]
> Requirements:
>  
> - **Object** *ACCELERATOR OBJECT TYPE* = `Hub`
> - A **Column** in the **Object** that references another *ACCELERATOR OBJECT TYPE* = `Hub`.

BimlFlex can automatically apply a Driving Key to any relationship created from a table being loaded with a *MODEL OBJECT TYPE* = `Hub`.
Due to the Foreign Keys in a database requiring a many-to-one in the source, the application of a Driving Key scenario can be applied.
This will be automatically included in the ETL logic and no separate **Attribute** will be added in the **Attributes Editor**.

### Default Driving Key Application

The default behavior within the BimlFlex Accelerator is to automatically apply Driving Key type relationships for any Links derived out of a Hub.

Any changes made to the Driving Key relationships by the user after the first accelerated modeling will be upheld in all future model accelerations.

### Manual Creation of Driving Keys

> [!NOTE]
> Prerequisites:
>  
> - The Link must already be accelerated.
> - The column to be used for the Driving Key must be on the LNK (not LSAT).

The simplest way to define a Driving Key within BimlFlex is from the **Objects** Editor.
Upon selecting the **Link** from the Objects editor tree and selecting the **Columns** view, a Driving Key may be assigned from the drop down menu in the *Change Type* column.

![Driving Key Assignment within Columns View](images/bfx-columns-view-driving-key.png "Driving Key Assignment within Colums View")

BimlFlex also allows manual definition of Driving Keys by way of **Column Attributes**.
This is done be flagging the required **Column** on the LNK with an **Attribute** to indicate that it is the Driving Key.
The BimlFlex App will automatically enforce a Driving Key relationship on the LSATs associated with the LNK, terminating relationships as needed.

**Objects** => Select LNK => Attributes Tab => [Add]

| Field          | Entered Value           |
| -------------- | ----------------------- |
| Attribute Type | Column                  |
| Column         | Column to be used as DK |
| Attribute      | IsDrivingKey            |

Driving Key settings are all adjusted in the "Add Attribute" dialog box:
