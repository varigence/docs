# BimlFlex Concepts Overview

This section covers various concepts that are important to understand when working with BimlFlex.

## Essential Concepts

### Customers

[!include[Customers](../concepts/_incl-header-customer.md)]

### Versions

[!include[Versions](../concepts/_incl-header-version.md)]

[!include[Versions](../metadata-editors/_incl-header-version.md)]

## Working with Design Metadata

[!include[BimlFlex](../metadata-editors/_incl-header-bimlflex-app.md)]

BimlFlex provides an import tool which is accessible from the Connections and Projects screens, which can connect to a database source and manage the metadata BimlFlex uses. The following links provide more information about managing design metadata:

* [Importing Metadata to BimlFlex](xref:bimlflex-concepts-importing-metadata)
* [Integration Keys](xref:bimlflex-concept-integration-keys)

## Data Solution Concepts

A data solution comprises of a number of concepts, technologies and decisions around information modeling and solution design. This section provides an overview of essential concepts that are part of these considerations, and how BimlFlex supports them.

### Architecture

Data solutions come in many shapes and forms, and BimlFlex aims to provide maximum configurability on the overall architecture of the solution. The following concepts are relevant for this:

* [The Persistent Staging Area](xref:bimlflex-concepts-persistent-staging-area)

### Delivery

Irrespective of the design of the data solution architecture, there are many options to make sure the design is delivered the way it is intended.
