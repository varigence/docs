# Initial Configuration

Before working with Snowflake metadata you should ensure that your environment is configured to use Snowflake appropriately.
This section will walk you through the required software and system configurations you will need to connect BimlFlex to your Snowflake environment.

### Implement Snowflake using Azure Data Factory

> [!NOTE]
> The example is intended to follow the guide for [Creating a Landing Area](xref:bimlflex-adf-landing-area#configure-a-landing-area-by-example).

The following video walks through the common steps and considerations for deploying an Azure Data Factory for Snowflake.

![BimlFlex - Implement Snowflake using Azure Data Factory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COGIHSjAdSg?rel=0&autoplay=0 "BimlFlex - Implement Snowflake using Azure Data Factory")

> [!NOTE]
> Additional BimlFlex documentation regarding the implementation of Snowflake in Azure Data Factory can be referenced [here](xref:bimlflex-snowflake-implementation)

### Installing and Configuring SnowSQL (SSIS Only)

When using SSIS Orchestration, BimlFlex uses a [Snowflake Custom SSIS Component](#bimlflex-snowflake-custom-ssis-components-ssis-only) that leverages SnowSQL and the SnowSQL `config` file to connect and move data.
This requires that SnowSQL be installed and the appropriate connection created on the server executing the SSIS packages.
Follow the below link for instructions on how to install SnowSQL.

> [!TIP]
> For additional details on installing SnowSQL refer to the below guide:  
> Snowflake Docs: [Installing SnowSQL](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowsql-install-config.html)

Once SnowSQL is installed a connection needs to be created in the specified `config` file.
The location may vary from depending on the installation but the default location for Windows is `%USERPROFILE%\.snowsql\`.
Open the file with any text editor and insert a connection following the template below.

### [Template](#tab/snowsql-connection-template)

```cmd
# BimlFlex Connection Template
[connections.<ConnectionName>]
accountname = <SnowflakeAccount>
username = <UserName>
password = <Password>
dbname = <DatabaseName>
schemaname = <SchemaName>
warehousename = <WarehouseName>
region = <Region>
```

### [Example](#tab/snowsql-connection-example)

```cmd
# BimlFlex Connection Example
[connections.bimlflex_db]
accountname = xy12345
username = MyUser
password = P@$$Word
dbname = bfx_sfl
schemaname = public
warehousename = compute_wh
region = west-us-2.azure
```

> Snowflake Docs: [Configuring SnowSQL](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowsql-config.html)

### Installing and Configuring a Snowflake ODBC DSN (Importing Metadata and SSIS Only)

The ODBC driver is only required if using SSIS orchestration to connect to a Snowflake `Source System`.
Currently Snowflake is not supported as a `Source System` when using ADF orchestration.

> [!TIP]
> For additional details on installing and configuring and ODBC driver and DSN refer to the below guides:  
> Snowflake Docs: [ODBC Driver](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/odbc.html)  
> Snowflake Docs: [Installing and Configuring the ODBC Driver for Windows](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/odbc-windows.html)  
> Microsoft Docs: [ODBC Data Source Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/odbc/admin/odbc-data-source-administrator)

### BimlFlex Snowflake Custom SSIS Components (SSIS Only)

The Snowflake load process uses a separate custom SSIS component to provide a solid query management experience in SSIS.
The components are installed and upgraded through the BimlFlex developer installation or the separate runtime installation for custom components.

> [!NOTE]
> If the components were not installed on initial installation they can be installed at a later date by re-running the installer.
> For additional details on installing BimlFlex and Custom Components refer to the below guide:

### Integration Stage

BimlFlex provides support for the use of Snowflake as both a target warehouse platform and as a `Source System`.
It is highly recommended that when using Snowflake as a target warehouse platform that a single database is used.
Naming patterns and schemas can be used for separation as needed.
The generated DDL does not currently support `USE DATABASE` or `USE WAREHOUSE` statements.
Deployment would require either 'Cherry Picking' the correct tables for each database or using **Generate Script Options** and scoping to a specific *Integration Stage* before each generation of the scripts.

#### Source System

BimlFlex supports Snowflake as a `Source System` for SSIS orchestration.
When using ADF orchestration Snowflake only has limited support via the use of Staged Query **Objects** due to lack of 1st party connector support in ADF.

#### Landing Area (ADF Only)

Snowflake is not currently supported as a `Landing Area` but a Landing Area is required when using ADF to orchestrate data movement.
The recommendation is for the `Landing Area` to be a *Connection Type* of `Azure Blob Storage` and *System Type* of `Flat File Delimited`.
In addition to the `Landing Area` it is also important that the **Settings* for an [Azure Blob Stage Container](#azure-storage-processing-settings-adf-only), [Azure Blob Archive Container](#azure-storage-processing-settings-adf-only), and [Azure Blob Error Container](#azure-storage-processing-settings-adf-only) are populated correctly.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that all Azure Blob Container **Settings** are configured properly:  
> [Azure Blob Stage Container](#azure-storage-processing-settings-adf-only)  
> [Azure Blob Archive Container](#azure-storage-processing-settings-adf-only)  
> [Azure Blob Error Container](#azure-storage-processing-settings-adf-only)

> Microsoft Docs: [Create an account SAS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/create-account-sas)

#### Persistent Staging Area

When using a `Persistent Staging Area` a `Source System` is required to have the *Persist History* box checked to have data persisted.

### Connection Type

Currently BimlFlex only supports the *Connection Type* of `ODBC SQL Based ELT` for a Snowflake **Connection** when being used as the target data warehouse platform.
When configuring a Snowflake *Integration Stage* of `Source System` set the *Connection Type* to `ODBC`.

### System Type

*System Type* should always be `Snowflake Data Warehouse` for any Snowflake **Connection**.

### Connection String

The [Snowflake Custom SSIS Component](#bimlflex-snowflake-custom-ssis-components-ssis-only) uses the connection information specified in the `.SnowSQL\config` file to connect.
See the [Snowflake SnowSQL Settings](#installing-and-configuring-snowsql-ssis-only) section for instructions on how to specify the file and connection to use.

BimlFlex only uses the *Connection String* field to generate an associated Connection Manager in SSIS.
The associated Connection Manager will be created in SSIS using the inputted *Connection String* but will not be used during any of the generated SSIS orchestration.

> [!NOTE]
> This guide only covers *Connection String* which is only used by SSIS orchestration.  For details on configuring the values of a Connection String Secret see the ADF Connection String Example in [Linked Services Section](#linked-services-adf-only).

### [SSIS Connection String](#tab/snowflake-connection-string-ssis)

```cmd
Dsn={DSN Name};Uid={User Name};Pwd={Password};Database={Database Name};
```

### [Example](#tab/snowflake-connection-string-ssis-example)

```cmd
Dsn=Snowflake_DSN;Uid=MyUser;Pwd=P@$$Word;Database=bfx_sfl;
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Then Connection Manager will also require the appropriate ODBC driver to be installed and a DSN created.  For additional details refer to the below guides:  
> Snowflake Docs: [ODBC Driver](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/odbc.html)  
> Snowflake Docs: [Installing and Configuring the ODBC Driver for Windows](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/odbc-windows.html)  
> Microsoft Docs: [ODBC Data Source Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/odbc/admin/odbc-data-source-administrator)

> [!TIP]
> For additional details on creating a **Connection** refer to the below guide:  
> BimlFlex Docs: [Connections](xref:bimlflex-connection-editor)

### Linked Services (ADF Only)

Azure Data Factory does not support Snowflake as a Linked Service so BimlFlex uses an [Azure Function Bridge](#azure-data-factory-function-bridge-settings-adf-only) to close the gap.
The Azure Function Bridge will use the Linked Service configured in BimlFlex to determine the appropriate connection method to use.

When using an *Azure Key Vault* use the below example to assist with the creation of a connection string to be used as the the secret value.
If using a *Connection String* version of a Linked Service fill out the required fields.

### [ADF Connection String](#tab/snowflake-connection-string-adf)

```cmd
host={Server Address};account={Account Name};user={User Name};password={Password};db={Database Name};schema={Schema Name};warehouse={Warehouse Name};
```

### [Example](#tab/snowflake-connection-string-adf-example)

```cmd
host=xy12345.west-us-2.azure.snowflakecomputing.com;account=xy12345;user=MyUser;password=P@$$Word;db=bfx_sfl;schema=public;warehouse=compute_wh;
```

## Deploying Target Warehouse Environment

When Snowflake is used as the target warehouse platform, BimlFlex will generate the required SnowSQL script for the deployment of all the tables, stored procedures, and the Data Vault default inserts (Ghost Keys).
Once generated the scripts can be manually deployed to the required database.

### Generating SnowSQL Scripts

Using Snowflake as the target warehouse platform requires the generation of the `Snowflake Table Script` and `Snowflake Procedure Script` options when using **Generate Scripts** in BimlStudio.
Additionally if Data Vault is being used the standard `Data Vault Default Insert Script` can be used to generate the required Ghost Keys.

> [!TIP]
> For additional details on generating DDL refer to the below guide:  
> BimlFlex Docs: [BimlFlexÂ GeneratingÂ DDL](xref:bimlflex-generating-ddl)

### Deploying SnowSQL Scripts

Once BimlFlex generates the scripts they can be executed against the target database.
These can be deployed through copy/paste using a Snowflake Worksheet or by a SnowSQL command if desired.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure you are using the appropriate WAREHOUSE and DATABASE when executing the SnowSQL scripts.  The scripts do not have a `USE DATABASE` or `USE WAREHOUSE` clause and depend on the user executing the script to have select the appropriate values.

> [!TIP]
> For additional details on using the SnowSQL CLI or Worksheets refer to the below guides:  
> Snowflake Docs: [Using SnowSQL](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowsql-use.html)  
> Snowflake Docs: [Using Worksheets for Queries](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-worksheet.html)

### Azure Environment (ADF Only)

The ADF Environment is deployed along with the orchestration.
For more details please refer to: [ADF Environment and Orchestration](#adf-environment-and-orchestration-adf-only)

## Deploying Orchestration

BimlFlex automatically generates the orchestration artifacts as part of the standard build process.
The actual artifacts generated depends on the method of orchestration that is used.
The below sections outline the various artifacts by orchestration methods.

### SSIS Packages (SSIS Only)

Deploying SSIS orchestration while using Snowflake as a target platform is no different a standard SSIS deployment using BimlFlex.
Refer to the below guides for common deployment methods.

Ensure these commonly missed steps are performed:

- [Install and Configure SnowSQL](#installing-and-configuring-snowsql-ssis-only)  
- [Install and Configure Snowflake ODBC DSN](#installing-and-configuring-a-snowflake-odbc-dsn-importing-metadata-and-ssis-only)
- [Install Snowflake SSIS Custom Components](#bimlflex-snowflake-custom-ssis-components-ssis-only)
- [SSIS Environment Settings](#ssis-catalog-settings-ssis-only)

> [!TIP]
> For additional details on generating deploying SSIS packages refer to the below guides:

> BimlFlex Docs: [DeploymentÂ ThroughÂ theÂ SSISÂ DeploymentÂ Wizard](xref:bimlflex-ssis-deployment-wizard)

### ADF Environment and Orchestration (ADF Only)

In addition to the common Azure artifacts, an Azure Function Bridge is also created and deployed to allow the use of Snowflake inside ADF as a target warehouse platform.
The process of deploying the Azure environment and ADF orchestration itself remains unchanged.

Ensure these commonly missed steps are performed:

- [Landing Area Created](#landing-area-adf-only)  
- [Linked Service Configured and Secrets Entered](#linked-services-adf-only)  
- [Azure Environment Settings](#azure-data-factory-settings-adf-only)  
- [Azure Function Bridge Settings](#azure-data-factory-function-bridge-settings-adf-only)  
- [Azure Blob Stage Container Settings](#azure-storage-processing-settings-adf-only)  
- [Azure Blob Archive Container Settings](#azure-storage-processing-settings-adf-only)  
- [Azure Blob Error Container Settings](#azure-storage-processing-settings-adf-only)
