The [**Schema Diagram Designer**](xref:bimlflex-schema-diagram) provides an Entity-Relationship view of the BimlFlex metadata. It assists the modeler in getting an overview of the metadata, and helps to execute common actions in a graphical interface.

The screenshot above shows the Schema Diagram of a subset of the imported source **Objects**.

Using the **Schema Diagram Designer** the properties of **Objects**, **Columns** can be modified. It is also possible to define new **Integration Keys** and use these to define references to other **Objects**.

These references, in turn, can be used to deliver the correct models using the [**Accelerator**](xref:bimlflex-data-vault-accelerator).
