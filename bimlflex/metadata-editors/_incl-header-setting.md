The [**Settings Editor**](xref:bimlflex-settings) is used to manage metadata and framework settings in the [BimlFlex App](xref:metadata-editors-overview).

By changing settings, the produced artifacts can adapt to specific requirements for file locations, naming conventions, data conventions, etc.

Align these settings with the organizations best practices and environmental requirements.
