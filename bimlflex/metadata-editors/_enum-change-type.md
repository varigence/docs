| Type 2              | Data Mart only.  Assigns the column to track historical changes of the column. |
| Fixed               | Once a value is populated ignore any further change(s). |
| Key                 | Indicates that the column is a key value in later downstream processing. |
| Ignore              | Assigns the column to be ignored from all processing. |
| Link Reference      | Generated by BimlFlex during acceleration.  Defines what columns and values are to transferred to the associated Link. |
| Change Data Capture | Indicates this column is used for Change Data Capture. |
| Multi Active Row    | Data Vault only.  Assigns the column to be a multi-active value for the associated object.  Used to determine the grain of a Multi-Active Satellite.  An object can have only one column defined as multi-active. This column must also be set to Primary Key together with the Integration Key. |
| Hash Distribution   | Synapse only.  Assigns the column to be used for hash distribution. |
| Exclude DV          | Process the column into staging but do not process/accelerate into the Data Vault. |
| Link Degenerate     | Data Vault only.  Assigns the column as part of the Unit of Work for a Link and will be included in the hashing of the Link's Surrogate Key (SK).  This is also know as a **dependent child key**. |
| Transient           | SSIS only.  Assigns the column to be used in relevant data flow tasks but not to persist the information.  Used when a column value is needed for an expression but the value of the column itself is not needed to be persisted. |
| Multi Active Set    | Data Vault Only.  Assigns the column to define a set for multi-activeness.  Used when a set of rows are active and maintained as a unit for the Satellite. |
