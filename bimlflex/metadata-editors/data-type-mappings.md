# Data Type Mappings Editor

BimlFlex **Data Type Mappings** provide the ability to map Data Types from a source system to another more standardized data type.  This can be either a conversion of the Data Type entirely, such as a `int` to a `bigint`, the expansion of an existing Data Type, such as `nvarchar(13)` to `nvarchar(20)`, or the combination of both, such as `char(1)` to `nvarchar(10)`.  

## Editor Overview

The following sections describe the UI elements of the Data Type Mappings Editor and how they are used to author and manage BimlFlex **Data Type Mappings**.

|Icon|Action|Description|
|-|-|-|
|<div class="icon-col m-5"><img src="images/svg-icons/save.svg" /></div>|<span class="nowrap-col m-5">Save</span>|This will save the current set of staged changes.  The **Save** button is only enabled if the **Data Type Mapping** has changes staged and there are no major validation issues with the current **Data Type Mapping** properties.|
| <div class="icon-col m-5"><img src="images/svg-icons/discard.svg" /></div> | Discard | This will **Discard** any unsaved changes and revert to last saved form. |
|<div class="icon-col m-5"><img src="images/svg-icons/datatype-mappings.svg" /></div>|<span class="nowrap-col m-5">Apply Data Type Mappings</span>|Brings up the [Apply Data Type Mappings Dialog](#apply-data-type-mappings-dialog-box) to apply all **Data Type Mappings** to a specified `Record Source`.  Note that this is the complete set of **Data Type Mappings** and not just the record that was previously selected.|
|<div class="icon-col m-5"><img src="images/bimlflex-app-action-switch.png" /></div>|<span class="nowrap-col m-5">Deleted</span>|This will soft delete the currently selected **Data Type Mapping**.  This will remove the **Data Type Mapping** from all processing and it will be excluded from all validation.|

|Field|Description|
|-|-|
| Data Type Mapping|Name of the **Data Type Mapping**.|
| Mapped To Data Type|The **Data Type Mapping** this type is mapped to.  If this value is populated then this **Data Type Mapping** will use the values specified by the *Mapped To Data Type*.
| Data Type | The type of data stored in this column using the [Unified System Types](#data-types).  Additional logic is required to cater for data types with a 'CustomType' like `hierarchyid`. |
| Default | The default value that should be used when a value is not received.  Be sure to verify that the value listed her is valid for the specified *Length*, *Precision* or *Scale*.|
| Length |Only applicable for a *Data Type* that requires this specification.  If the **Data Type Mapping** does not have a *Mapped To Data Type* and *Is Master* then this value represents the value to be used when a column is created using this **Data Type Mapping**.  If the **Data Type Mapping** has a *Mapped To Data Type* then it is the maximum value that will be included when mapping to the *Mapped To Data Type*.  Note that when there are multiple mappings for the same *Data Type* the lowest values are checked first.|
| Precision |Only applicable for a *Data Type* that requires this specification.  If the **Data Type Mapping** does not have a *Mapped To Data Type* and *Is Master* then this value represents the value to be used when a column is created using this **Data Type Mapping**.  If the **Data Type Mapping** has a *Mapped To Data Type* then it is the maximum value that will included when mapping to the *Mapped To Data Type*.  Note that when there are multiple mappings for the same *Data Type* the lowest values are checked first.|
| Scale |Only applicable for a *Data Type* that requires this specification.  If the **Data Type Mapping** does not have a *Mapped To Data Type* and *Is Master* then this value represents the value to be used when a column is created using this **Data Type Mapping**.  If the **Data Type Mapping** has a *Mapped To Data Type* then it is the maximum value that will included when mapping to the *Mapped To Data Type*.  Note that when there are multiple mappings for the same *Data Type* the lowest values are checked first.|
| Ordinal |This value is used to determine the default sort order when populating the navigation/value pane on the right side of the screen.|
| System Type | If unspecified the **Data Type Mapping** will be applied to all system types.  When specified, defines the *System Type* that is required in order to apply the **Data Type Mapping**.  This is commonly used to control the mapping of more complex data types such as Date and DateTime variants as syntax and functions differ from system to system. Must be a valid [System Type](#system-types).|
| SQL Source Expression |SQL expression for this column is used to extend source queries. Generally used for source type casting and case statements. Example, `CONVERT(VARCHAR(27), @@this, 121)`|
| SSIS Dataflow Expression |The expression used to calculate the value of the derived column via SSIS.  SSIS expression syntax is used. Example, `(DT_DBTIMESTAMP2, 7)([DTM_@@this])` |
| ADF Dataflow Expression | The expression used to calculate the value of the derived column via ADF.  ADF expression syntax is used.|
| SQL Target Expression | The SQL expression used to extend target queries. Generally used for source type casting and case statements. Example, `CONVERT(VARCHAR(27), @@this, 121)`|
| SQL Target To String | This SQL expression is used when a datatype needs to be converted to a string.|
| SQL Target To Data Type | This SQL expression is used when a string datatype needs to be converted to another datatype.|
| Description |Optional metadata to provide description.|
| Column Alias |Maps to a **Columns** *Column Alias* field. Example, `DTM_@@this`|
| Is Master |If `true` this **Data Type Mapping** may be used as a *Mapped To Data Type*.|
| Convert Source Type | When enabled, applies the *DATA TYPE, LENGTH, PRECISION* and *SCALE* from the Data Type Mappings to the *DATA TYPE, LENGTH, PRECISION* and *SCALE* property of the Columns with the defined data types if the APPLY CONVERT DATA TYPE MAPPING is selected when using the [Apply Data Type Mappings] button. |
