### Objects Tab - Views

The **Objects Tab** provides quick and easy access to all **Objects** associated with the selected entity.
While the items in the list will not change, the views provide a quick concise view of various groupings of attributes.
General purpose and overview of each view will be outlined below.

> [!NOTE]
> See the [Objects Documentation](objects.md) for further details on creating or editing and **Object** along with details on individual property values.

#### View: Overview

The **Overview** is available to give quick access to the more physical properties of the **Objects** relating to the selected entity.
These are representations of the physical `Source System` and represent the raw definitions of the object in its original form.
Additional properties are available for bulk management such as controlling exclusions, disabling persistence, or flagging an **Object** for deletion.
Various [Navigational Transitions](#objects-tab-overview-navigational-transitions) are available on view form and outlined below.

#### Objects Tab (Overview) Navigational Transitions

| Item             | Action                                                               | Entity Documentation                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Project Value    | Navigate to **Projects Editor**, selecting clicked **Project**       | [Projects Documentation](projects.md)       |
| Connection Value | Navigate to **Connections Editor**, selecting clicked **Connection** | [Connections Documentation](connections.md) |
| Object Value     | Navigate to **Objects Editor**, selecting clicked **Object**         | [Objects Documentation](objects.md)         |

> [!NOTE]
> The **Object** navigational transition is the only one provided on the additional views.
> As such, no further callouts will be made to this.
> Functionality on the below forms however is consistent: click the **Object** name to navigate to the selected **Object** in the [Objects Editor](objects.md).

#### View: Model Overrides

The **Model Overrides** view allows for quick management of modeled metadata from the [Data Vault Accelerator](../modeling-tools/accelerator.md) or the [Schema Diagram](../modeling-tools/schema-diagram.md).
This view is intended as an easy way to reference and maintain previously entered metadata.

    title="Objects Tab - Model Overrides View"
/>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although it is possible for an experienced user to manage their high level metadata from this screen, it is recommended that you use the [Data Vault Accelerator](../modeling-tools/accelerator.md) until you are strongly confident in your abilities to manually model metadata.
> The [Data Vault Accelerator](../modeling-tools/accelerator.md) is specifically designed to simplify and improve the experience of modeling metadata via a graphical designer as opposed to the table entry that this view provides.

#### View: Query Overrides

The **Query Overrides** view exposes any SQL overrides that may be required in the creation and maintenance of the **Object**.
By default the SQL required to perform most ETL/ELT task are dynamically generated and in many cases these overrides are not required.
When these cases are encounter they can be seen and managed from this view.

    title="Objects Tab - Query Overrides View"
/>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to the BimlFlex App not requiring a connection to the raw source systems (this is done during ELT/ELT Orchestration and Integration), auto-complete and intellisense are not provided.
This is designed for developers/architects who have a strong understanding of SQL and knowledge of the Source Systems that are designing from.

#### View: Dependencies

The **Dependencies** view allows for management of an **Object's** dependencies or inheritance.
Dependencies are provided to instruct BimlFlex as to what **Objects** are required to be processed or managed before another.
Inheritance is a provided feature that allows for controlled reuse of previously entered metadata.
