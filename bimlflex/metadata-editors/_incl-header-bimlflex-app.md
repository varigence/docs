The primary source BimlFlex uses to generate data solutions assets is *design metadata*, simply referred to as 'metadata'. Metadata is most commonly in the form of [**Objects**](xref:bimlflex-object-editor) with corresponding properties, such as [**Columns**](xref:bimlflex-column-editor) and [**Settings**](xref:bimlflex-setting-editor).

Although it is relatively straightforward to define individual metadata objects, it can take considerable time and effort to create, update and maintain the number of objects that would typically be involved in an enterprise data solution.

The [BimlFlex App](xref:metadata-editors-overview) allows users to add and update all the metadata required to automate complex data solutions, without ever writing a single line of code.

Developing data solutions is not always easy, and may need many specific designs and modifications to fully meet requirements. To be able to manage this complexity in a streamlined way, BimlFlex provides a variety of [editors](xref:metadata-editors-overview), configurations, overrides and design features.

The BimlFlex App is the main design area to configure your intended data solution. It consists of a number of metadata editors that are visible in the left-hand navigation panel.
