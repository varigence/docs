The [BimlFlex App](xref:metadata-editors-overview) allows users to add and update all the metadata required to automate complex data solutions, without ever writing a single line of code.

Developing data solutions is not always easy, and may need many specific designs and modifications to fully meet requirements. To be able to manage this complexity in a streamlined way, BimlFlex provides a variety of editors, configurations, overrides and design features.

The BimlFlex App is the main design area to configure your intended data solution. It consists of a number of metadata editors that are visible in the left-hand navigation panel.
