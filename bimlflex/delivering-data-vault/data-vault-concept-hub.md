# Hubs

A Hub in Data Vault is the representation of a `Core Business Concept`. These are the main 'things' that are important to an organisation. Core Business Concepts are related to other ones through [Natural Business Relationships](xref:bimlflex-data-vault-concept-link) and are described using [Context](xref:bimlflex-data-vault-concept-satellite) entities.

Any Hub entity in Data Vault can therefore have multiple active relationships to other entities through [Links](xref:bimlflex-data-vault-concept-link).
