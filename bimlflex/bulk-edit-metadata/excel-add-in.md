## User Interface

![Excel Add-in UI](../user-guide/images/bimlflex-ss-v5-excel-documentation-ui.png "Excel Add-in UI")

The BimlFlex Excel ribbon and tab is located at the top right-hand side of the standard Excel UI. This is where the UI for BimlFlex is located.

The BimlFlex Excel Add-in Ribbon tab is made up of 5 main groups:

* [Metadata Tools](#metadata-tools)
* [Retrieve Metadata](#retrieve-metadata)
* [Publish Metadata](#publish-metadata)
* [Other](#other)
* Status (hidden when everything is ok)

Metadata Tools is as section containing tools and functionality that allows high level control over metadata. Importing metadata, connecting to various metadata sources or generating overview documentation of metadata.

Retrieve Metadata is about getting the metadata from the metadata database (the BimlFlex Database) and bringing that metadata into Excel.

Publish Metadata allows Excel to save changed metadata back to the metadata database.

Other and Status sections apply to when BimlFlex Excel Add-in is inspecting the metadata. When an issue is encountered, the Status section will display any validation messages.

## Excel Sheets

The BimlFlex Add-in displays the metadata in a set of Excel sheets. These are normal Excel sheets. To navigate between them, click the sheet tab at the bottom of the Excel window.
