## Advanced Customization

No data solution can be completely delivered by only using generic patterns. Customization of certain areas in the solution will be needed to cater for situation-specific edge cases that are unique to your environment, requirements and challenges.

BimlFlex offers a wide array of customization mechanisms that allow specific tweaking of the solution at a very detailed level.
