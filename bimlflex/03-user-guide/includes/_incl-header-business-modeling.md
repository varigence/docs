The BimlFlex [**Business Modeling**](xref:bimlflex-business-modeling) feature supports designing a holistic model that describes the business' data, while avoiding bias from already existing systems and data structures.

Traditionally, this process involves a team of IT and business representatives collaborating in a series of workshops to define the business' Core Business Concepts (CBCs), how they are described and how they interact with each other.

Business Models can be created using predefined Ensemble Logical Modeling (ELM) or Party & Party Role (PPR) approaches, or by defining a custom set of classifications and labels. For example, by defining types such as Subjects, People, Events or Places.

These types of Business Model objects are represented as 'tiles' or 'cards' on the model design board.

While working on a Business Model, these tiles can be rearranged, detailed and updated on the model design board with minimal effort in a way that is similar to reorganizing Post-It notes on a whiteboard.

The Business Modeling feature is accessible from the main BimlFlex side menu in the [BimlFlex Application](xref:bimlflex-editors-overview), under the 'Modeling' section.

The entities and relationships that are defined in the business model are intended to consider suitable terms and definitions before implementing the solution. In BimlFlex, the output of the modeling efforts can be used to shape the physical model in the [Accelerator](xref:bimlflex-data-vault-accelerator). The business modeling entities can be assigned to objects in the Accelerator, effectively mapping source data to business entities and drive the structure of the physical model.
