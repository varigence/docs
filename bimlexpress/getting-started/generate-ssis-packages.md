# Generate SSIS Packages

A Biml file can be expanded into one or more SSIS packages by choosing **Generate SSIS Packages** from the menu. Expanding a file will automatically run an error check.

![Generate SSIS Packages](../images/generate-packages.jpg "Generate SSIS Packages")

If the Biml file was expanded successfully, it will be added to the SSIS Packages folder in the project.
