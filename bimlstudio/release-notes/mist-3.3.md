  - Oracle connections are now supported, including modeling the connections and using them to import tables
  - The Attunity Oracle Source and Oracle Destination components are now fully supported with native language tags (no more custom component tags)
  - Just like the Attunity components in BIDS/SSDT, Mist will dynamically check for the presence of the Oracle Data Access Components, and build only if they are present.

- BalancedDataDistributor
  - This is a component that is shipped by Microsoft as a separate download.  It is now fully supported with native language tags

- MultiFile and MultiFlatFile Connections
  - The HasMultipleFiles boolean property has been added to the existing FileConnection and FlatFileConnection nodes.  When present, the FilePath property will automatically accept wildcard syntax

## Improved UI Functionality

- General
  - Updated almost all Mist icons to be sharper and more Modern-UI friendly.
  - When no items are present in a tree or grid control, the message now identifies the parent by name for clarity
  - When no items are present in a tree or grid control, there is now an add button with a tooltip detailing the ways to add new items
  - Mist now starts in Logical View by default. It will subsequently remember window layout of the last run.

  - Made it so that Execute Transformers context menu is hidden on script-generated assets.
  - Visibility of the grid details pane is now collapsed when multiple items in a datagrid are selected.
  - DataGrid row highlight style is grey instead of blue when the control is not active.  This should clarify which controls have focus.

- Treeviews
  - When you single-click an already focused tree item, it enters edit mode.
  - Expanding/collapsing a node will now ensure move it to the appropriate place within the scroll window.
  - Focus now remains consistent on expand/collapse.

## Build Engine

- Performance
  - Massively improved performance of escape character handling in the literal strings for SSIS expressions.
  - Massive improvement to script project compilation by batching and precompiling all of the scripts used to generate the code behind files.

- BimlScript Processing
  - Fixed issue where negative tiers were not being handled as file references in live processing engine.
  - Tier 0 references to higher tiers now are fully supported during incremental processing.
  - Fixed issue where higher tier BimlScript couldn't see lower tier assets after equal or lower tier assets are changed in live processing engine.

  - Packages with Text columns as source and destination now emit correctly (without an unnecessary NText conversion).
  - SSIS data flow path names are now scrubbed for invalid characters in task/component names
  - Attribute ordering on Package node in SSIS has been changed to avoid confusing SSDT when it tries to upgrade a Biml-generated package to SSIS2012.
  - Fixed underscore and other invalid character removal from automatically generated property names in script component code behind.
  - Added methods to correctly quote identifiers for each database SchemaProvider.
  - Updated command line documentation for hadron.exe for the buildOnly option.

- Name Management

  - When editing an asset name in the property grid, the Biml file rename dialog no longer triggers unless the name actually changes value.
  - Improved file copy/paste and duplicate naming to put " - Copy" at the end.

- Validation
  - Added a warning validation for when Attribute Relationship name does not match the name of the child attribute.  This is to keep BIDS/SSDT from issuing a warning.
  - Fixed bug with over-aggressive Aggregate transformation diagnostic.
  - Fixed validator to prevent it from crashing the validation thread when a package or variable name is not set.
  - Added a build-time diagnostic to validate that input buffer column types in script components match the input columns to which they are wired in the dataflow.
  - Prevented sql parse exceptions from killing the validator thread.

## Import

- Package Importer
  - SSIS Importer is now smarter when importing custom properties on custom components that contain lineage IDs
  - PersistFileConnection is now imported correctly for CacheConnections
  - When Importer creates an ImportedProjectConnection, it now sets CreateInProject = true
  - Importer now handles SynchronousInputId correctly for custom components in SSIS 2012

- Added Ctrl+Shift+B keyboard shortcut for build.
- Reduced CPU usage of background services when Mist is idle.
