# BimlStudio 2018.1 Release Notes

Significant changes between BimlStudio 2017 and BimlStudio 2018

## Azure Data Factory Support

Added support for all ADF version 2 items and is current as of 06/20/2018. This includes the ability to:

* Create all new V2 Linked Services

## BimlScript PreCompiled Assembly Package (BSPCAP) Files

* Added option to Build & Deploy ribbon to create new BimlScript PreCompiled Assembly Package (BSPCAP) files, which include the pre-processed binary assets for all of the BimlScript files in your project. This will avoid a significant amount of processing time in solutions with large codebases, both in interactive designer mode and for command line builds.
* Added support for BSPCAP files within Biml Bundles, where they achieve even greater performance savings.
* Added support to add BSPCAP files through all BimlStudio menus and via the command line as a source file. 


## BimlStudio UI Updates

* Improved styling in the Package Import dialog, by widening the file path textbox, adjusting the height of the file path textbox, and making the buttons uniform. Also eliminated unnecessary columns in the DTSX file path grid.

* In Package Import dialog, we now provide users the option to create an SSIS Import Options Json file, in order to save your SSIS import options for use with command line imports.
* Added support for guaranteeing that a Biml file's expansion result hasn't changed since the previous expansion, which can improve performance.
* Revamped the Debug utility in BimlFlex projects, now users are able to extract their metadata, while also zipping up their project directory, for aid in debugging through Varigence support.
* Changed "recent path" saving to help with more consistent saving of recent paths.

## BimlStudio Bugs

* Fixed issue with extra `xmlns` declarations when expanding BimlScript files in BimlStudio.
* Fixed possible exception in drag and drop in BimlStudio.
* Fixed the uninstall survey link in the bootstrapper to point to the correct address (www.varigence.com).
* Fixed issue where BimlStudio’s "Format Document" functionality disrupted Annotation Tags with variable values.
* Fix for Null Reference Exception in `BimlTemplateLoader`.
* Fix for Biml files being parsed while unloaded for editing.
* Fixed issue where changes to the MsBuild paths, BimlEngine paths, and DiffViewer settings were not being tracked by BimlStudio.
* Fixed issue with new BimlFlex projects where 32 bit versions of BimlStudio were not finding the 64 bit BimlFlex.xlsx (for use with 64 bit Excel).

## Source Control

* Fixed bug where folders under source control were displaying as "checked-in", even when they contained files with pending changes.
* In the History tab, the number of changes was always being displayed as 1, now it accurately displays the correct number of changes that were pushed in a commit.
* More descriptive label for renames that displays the changed portion of the file path.
* Disabled the UI when committing to source control, in order to prevent undesired behavior.
* When launching the file comparison tool in the History tab, the commit history list box is now disabled, as changing your selection while the tool launched produced unpredictable results.
* In Project view context menus, disabled "Revert" command for newly added files.
* When launching the file comparison tool in the History tab, it is now done asynchronously, as we sometimes need to get information from a remote server, which caused the UI to lock.
* Fixed bug where new projects without a template were not being tracked as eligible for source control.
* For Svn, previously, in order to see the historical file contents, a version of the file had to still exist locally, now if the file has been completely deleted or renamed, we are still able to retrieve its contents from the server.
* For Git, fixed bug where commits were getting added to both "Outgoing" and "History", causing duplicates in the History tab.
* For Git, fixed bug that was preventing file comparisons.
* For Git, fixed bug where the push/sync commands would still fire after a failed fetch command.
* For TFS, Fixed bug where BimlStudio was not recognizing TFS projects that had a space in the file path.
* For TFS, improved error logging to help with diagnosis of issues.

## Tabular Support

* In `AstTabularRelationshipNode`, added a `SourceColumn` property with a schema binding of `TabularColumnName`.
* In `AstTabularRelationshipNode`, `TargetColumn` property now has a schema binding of `TargetTabularColumnName`.
* In `AstTabularModelNode`, `OutputModelLabel` property is changed to `OutputLabel`. Also added a `Relationships` property composed of a collection of `AstTabularRelationshipNodes`.
* Added ability to specify tabular column relationships at the model level, in addition to within the `AnalysisMetadata` section of a table.
* Now displays the correct names of the various assets in Tabular relationships and perspectives.
* Added documentation to the following Tabular enumerations: `InferRelationshipMode`, `TabularModelPermission`, `TabularRelationshipCardinality`, `TabularRelationshipFilterDirection`.
* Changed friendly type name from `TabularTableColumn` to `TabularColumn`
* Now setting correct values for `DeploymentServerDatabase` and `DeploymentServerCubeName` in the `smproj` file in all instances
* Now setting the name for roles correctly in all instances
* Fixed issue where underscores in asset names would not be displayed in the `CubeProject` and `PackageProject` designers

* Added DisplayFolder property to SSAS Tabular Table Columns

## Performance

* Fixed issue where an ICE would be generated on builds with warnings in some cases.
* Added the `tempPath` setting to the Biml compiler. This setting specifies the temporary path that will be used for intermediate assets during the build process.
* Removed memory leak due to repeated `xslt` transforms.
* Now auto-generating BimlC Response file on every build and placing it in the project directory.
* Reduced memory and eliminated Out Of Memory exceptions when creating ISPAC files for large SSIS projects.

## Provider Support

* Fixed data type mappings for Excel `GetDatabaseSchema()`.
* Added logging to `GetQuerySchema()` method.
* Added compression to SQL Server `GetDatabaseSchema()`.
* Change the DB2 provider to reference `SYSIBM` system tables instead of the `SYSCAT` views, as they are sometimes missing.
* Fixed Excel support in OLEDB connections in Biml.
* Fixed date datatype mapping in ACE OLEDB provider.
* Added custom type mappings to `ExternalDataAccess.GetQuerySchema()`.

## Biml Language

* Added ColumnStore and ColumnStoreArchive to `TableCompressionType` enumeration.
* Fixed spelling errors in Biml documentation for `ProcessionOrder.Sequential`, `ProcessingOrder.Parallel`, and `ContainerConstraintMode.LinearOnSuccess`.
* Added correct schema binding for `TextQualifier` to fix the misspelling in the Biml language.
* Implemented `ICollection` interface for `TierFilteredVulcanCollection` to fix issue with Preview when using extension methods from `codefile`.
* Eliminated unnecessary and potentially buggy code for finding schema names of items based on being referenced rather than definitions, resulting in items unexpectedly emitting as `<AstNode>` in XML.
* Fixed Xml emitter for singleton references in Biml with multiple schema bindings, for example, in `AstLookupNodes`, all connection references were emitted as `OleDbConnectionName`, and now they are accurately emitted as either `OleDbConnectionName`, `CacheConnectionName`, or `CustomSSISConnectionName`.
* Improved Json emission.
* Fixed `EncryptSensitiveWithUserKey` emission issue.
* Fixed Issue where annotations on certain elements were being duplicated in the object model.

* Ability to create `Bimlc` response files for command line compiling
* Added DDL Build mode options to project settings and CL options for selecting the type of DDL script emission to do for relational objects in the project
* Added an option in the Project Settings panel to create a `Bimlc` response file for use with `bimlc.exe`

* Added caching timestamps so that extension points and CallBimlScripts that use dynamic objects can still be cached when neither the extension point nor the dynamic object schema has changed
