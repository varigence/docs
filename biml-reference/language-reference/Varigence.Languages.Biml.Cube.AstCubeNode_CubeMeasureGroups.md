# Cube Measure Groups

<div class="LanguageSummary"><div class ="SummaryItem">This collection is used to define instances of fact tables that are used in the cube as measure groups. Each fact table might be referenced by multiple cube measure groups in cases where a single fact table might be used in multiple ways. For example, a fact table that tracks customer activity might be used both in a sales and an account measure group for a sales-tracking cube.</div></div><div class="SchemaBindingGroup"><div class="SchemaBindingGroupHeader">Permitted Collection Child Definitions</div><table id="SchemaBindingList" class="SchemaBindingList"><tbody><tr><th class="SchemaBindingNameColumnHeader">Child</th><th class="SchemaBindingTypeColumnHeader">API Type</th><th class="SchemaBindingSummaryColumnHeader">Description</th></tr><tr class="cd0"><td class="SchemaBindingName"><span class="punc">&lt;</span><a href=Varigence.Languages.Biml.MeasureGroup.AstCubeMeasureGroupNode.html">CubeMeasureGroup</a><span class="punc"> /&gt;</span></td><td class="SchemaBindingType"><a href="../api-reference/Varigence.Languages.Biml.MeasureGroup.AstCubeMeasureGroupNode.html">AstCubeMeasureGroupNode</a></td><td class="SchemaBindingSummary">A measure group associates dimensions with measures and groups measures to optimize processing.
