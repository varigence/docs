# Designing and delivering a Data Vault with BimlFlex

Data Vault provides an easy-to-explain and flexible way to tackle complex issues for bringing data together, and BimlFlex is optimized to deliver data solutions that have adopted this approach.

The Data Vault design and development can be done quickly and efficiently, using the BimlFlex [Data Vault Accelerator](../metadata-editors/accelerator).

This guide assumes the BimlFlex product has been installed, configured and that the sample source metadata is ready to be modeled.

## BimlFlex Concepts for Data Vault

BimlFlex provides various ways to implement data solutions that utilize concepts from Data Vault methodology:

## Delivering Data

BimlFlex allows the creation of a Dimensional Model (Data Mart) from metadata. This can be based on existing objects, such as Satellites, Point-In-Time or Bridge objects, or views added as a separation-of-concern layer on top of the 'Raw' and 'Business' Data Vault constructs.
