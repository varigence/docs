# BimlFlex Excel Add-in

The Excel-based Metadata Editor is opened from the BimlFlex Ribbon tab in BimlStudio. The Excel Add-in provides an optional environment for bulk-editing metadata.

The BimlFlex Excel metadata editor comes with an additional Excel tab in the Ribbon for interacting with BimlFlex.

Configure the BimlFlex database connection in the **Metadata Connection** pane and connect to the BimlFlex Database.

Once the connection is defined the metadata can be read into Excel. The main data is stored in the database and the working set is cached and displayed in Excel. The data is not updated in real-time. It is important to commit changes to the database and to communicate within the development team to synchronize changes to the Metadata.

Retrieve all metadata into Excel by clicking the `Get All Entities` and `Get All Settings` buttons in the Excel BimlFlex Ribbon UI.

BimlFlex Excel Add-in is the tool modelers and developers use to interact with the solution metadata. BimlFlex Excel Add-in connects to the BimlFlex Database.

## Getting Started

## User Interface

![Excel Add-in UI](/img/bimlflex/bimlflex-ss-v5-excel-documentation-ui.png "Excel Add-in UI")

The BimlFlex Excel ribbon and tab is located at the top right-hand side of the standard Excel UI. This is where the UI for BimlFlex is located.

The BimlFlex Excel Add-in Ribbon tab is made up of 5 main groups:

* [Metadata Tools](#metadata-tools)
* [Retrieve Metadata](#retrieve-metadata)
* [Publish Metadata](#publish-metadata)
* [Other](#other)
* Status (hidden when everything is ok)

Metadata Tools is as section containing tools and functionality that allows high level control over metadata. Importing metadata, connecting to various metadata sources or generating overview documentation of metadata.

Retrieve Metadata is about getting the metadata from the [BimlFlex Database](../installation/installing-metadata-database) and bringing that metadata into Excel.

Publish Metadata allows Excel to save changed metadata back to the BimlFlex database.

Other and Status sections apply to when BimlFlex Excel Add-in is inspecting the metadata. When an issue is encountered, the Status section will display any validation messages.

## Excel Sheets

The BimlFlex Add-in displays the metadata in a set of Excel sheets. These are normal Excel sheets. To navigate between them, click the sheet tab at the bottom of the Excel window.
