description: Overview of the BimlFlex Configurations concept.

BimlFlex [**Configurations**](bimlflex-configuration-editor) define exactly how data is intended to be processed, through which steps in the architecture, and by using what technology.

The [**Configuration Editor**](bimlflex-configuration-editor) is used to manage standard [**Columns**](bimlflex-column-editor) and how, when and where these are added to [**Objects**](bimlflex-object-editor). These standard columns can be configured to drive the behavior of the output that BimlFlex generates.

Configurations can be used to support requirements for file locations, naming conventions, data conventions and standard system columns.

The defaults for the configurations that are set as part of the BimlFlex installation are the Varigence recommended values. There is no need to change or configure unless there is a requirement to change specific behaviors. Align these settings with the organization's best practices and environmental requirements.
