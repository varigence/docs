BimlFlex [**Objects**](./object-editor) are data sets defined in metadata.

Objects closely mirror a Relational Database table, though not every object will translate directly to a table because BimlFlex also supports flat files, Excel documents and, via use of Extensions Points, APIs calls. Instead of using multiple entity types to handle these different sources of data, BimlFlex defines each as an object and uses the **Object Type** field to annotate what type of object is being referenced.  

Objects are created and edited using the [**Object Editor**](./project-editor) in the [BimlFlex App](./index).
