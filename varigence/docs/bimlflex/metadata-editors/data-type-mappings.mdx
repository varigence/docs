# Data Type Mappings Editor

BimlFlex **Data Type Mappings** provide the ability to map Data Types from a source system to another more standardized data type.  This can be either a conversion of the Data Type entirely, such as a `int` to a `bigint`, the expansion of an existing Data Type, such as `nvarchar(13)` to `nvarchar(20)`, or the combination of both, such as `char(1)` to `nvarchar(10)`.  

Data Type Mappings is a BimlFlex feature that expands the Data Types of the source to a larger data type that is more accommodating. This is done to accommodate changes in the source system without the need to update the data solution, or the load process. The most common expansions are for short string representations that might be updated in the source.

A 'Name' field of 20 characters might be updated to 250 to accommodate longer customer names, or it might be changed from `varchar` to `nvarchar` to accommodate international characters. An `integer` might be updated to `big int` when the source counter nears its maximum allowed value.

By expanding incoming data it is possible to cater for these future changes before they become a load issue.

>[!NOTE]
> Note that larger data types might require more database resources.

BimlFlex provides a rules engine for applying the expansions based on the Business Requirements. Based on the configuration, BimlFlex can apply the expansions across all columns for a source and all tables and load patterns will take the new expanded type into consideration.

The expanded data types will be used in the source to staging load and the new data types will be used in both Staging and Persistent Staging. When the Data Vault accelerator is run on the source metadata the Satellite attributes will inherit the expanded data types from the source definition.

## Overview

The following sections describe the UI elements of the Data Type Mappings Editor and how they are used to author and manage BimlFlex **Data Type Mappings**.

|Icon|Action|Description|
|-|-|-|
|<div class="icon-col m-5"><img src="images/svg-icons/save.svg" /></div>|<span class="nowrap-col m-5">Save</span>|This will save the current set of staged changes.  The **Save** button is only enabled if the **Data Type Mapping** has changes staged and there are no major validation issues with the current **Data Type Mapping** properties.|
| <div class="icon-col m-5"><img src="images/svg-icons/discard.svg" /></div> | Discard | This will **Discard** any unsaved changes and revert to last saved form. |
|<div class="icon-col m-5"><img src="images/svg-icons/datatype-mappings.svg" /></div>|<span class="nowrap-col m-5">Apply Data Type Mappings</span>|Brings up the [Apply Data Type Mappings Dialog](#apply-data-type-mappings-dialog) to apply all **Data Type Mappings** to a specified `Record Source`.  Note that this is the complete set of **Data Type Mappings** and not just the record that was previously selected.|
|<div class="icon-col m-5"><img src="images/bimlflex-app-action-switch.png" /></div>|<span class="nowrap-col m-5">Deleted</span>|This will soft delete the currently selected **Data Type Mapping**.  This will remove the **Data Type Mapping** from all processing and it will be excluded from all validation.|

|Field|Description|
|-|-|
| Data Type Mapping|Name of the **Data Type Mapping**.|
| Mapped To Data Type|The **Data Type Mapping** this type is mapped to.  If this value is populated then this **Data Type Mapping** will use the values specified by the *Mapped To Data Type*.
| Data Type | The type of data stored in this column using the [Unified System Types](#data-types).  Additional logic is required to cater for data types with a 'CustomType' like `hierarchyid`. |
| Default | The default value that should be used when a value is not received.  Be sure to verify that the value listed her is valid for the specified *Length*, *Precision* or *Scale*.|
| Length |Only applicable for a *Data Type* that requires this specification.  If the **Data Type Mapping** does not have a *Mapped To Data Type* and *Is Master* then this value represents the value to be used when a column is created using this **Data Type Mapping**.  If the **Data Type Mapping** has a *Mapped To Data Type* then it is the maximum value that will be included when mapping to the *Mapped To Data Type*.  Note that when there are multiple mappings for the same *Data Type* the lowest values are checked first.|
| Precision |Only applicable for a *Data Type* that requires this specification.  If the **Data Type Mapping** does not have a *Mapped To Data Type* and *Is Master* then this value represents the value to be used when a column is created using this **Data Type Mapping**.  If the **Data Type Mapping** has a *Mapped To Data Type* then it is the maximum value that will included when mapping to the *Mapped To Data Type*.  Note that when there are multiple mappings for the same *Data Type* the lowest values are checked first.|
| Scale |Only applicable for a *Data Type* that requires this specification.  If the **Data Type Mapping** does not have a *Mapped To Data Type* and *Is Master* then this value represents the value to be used when a column is created using this **Data Type Mapping**.  If the **Data Type Mapping** has a *Mapped To Data Type* then it is the maximum value that will included when mapping to the *Mapped To Data Type*.  Note that when there are multiple mappings for the same *Data Type* the lowest values are checked first.|
| Ordinal |This value is used to determine the default sort order when populating the navigation/value pane on the right side of the screen.|
| System Type | If unspecified the **Data Type Mapping** will be applied to all system types.  When specified, defines the *System Type* that is required in order to apply the **Data Type Mapping**.  This is commonly used to control the mapping of more complex data types such as Date and DateTime variants as syntax and functions differ from system to system. Must be a valid [System Type](#system-types).|
| SQL Source Expression |SQL expression for this column is used to extend source queries. Generally used for source type casting and case statements. Example, `CONVERT(VARCHAR(27), @@this, 121)`|
| SSIS Dataflow Expression |The expression used to calculate the value of the derived column via SSIS.  SSIS expression syntax is used. Example, `(DT_DBTIMESTAMP2, 7)([DTM_@@this])` |
| ADF Dataflow Expression | The expression used to calculate the value of the derived column via ADF.  ADF expression syntax is used.|
| SQL Target Expression | The SQL expression used to extend target queries. Generally used for source type casting and case statements. Example, `CONVERT(VARCHAR(27), @@this, 121)`|
| SQL Target To String | This SQL expression is used when a datatype needs to be converted to a string.|
| SQL Target To Data Type | This SQL expression is used when a string datatype needs to be converted to another datatype.|
| Description |Optional metadata to provide description.|
| Column Alias |Maps to a **Columns** *Column Alias* field. Example, `DTM_@@this`|
| Is Master |If `true` this **Data Type Mapping** may be used as a *Mapped To Data Type*.|
| Convert Source Type | When enabled, applies the *DATA TYPE, LENGTH, PRECISION* and *SCALE* from the Data Type Mappings to the *DATA TYPE, LENGTH, PRECISION* and *SCALE* property of the Columns with the defined data types if the APPLY CONVERT DATA TYPE MAPPING is selected when using the [Apply Data Type Mappings] button. |
