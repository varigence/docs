# BimlFlex Database Settings

The *Database Settings* manages the connection to the BimlFlex database. It is where you can set the server and database that is used for the recording of BimlFlex metadata. Additional properties such as Show Deleted and Show Excluded also reside here.

The database settings can be accessed from the [BimlFlex Toolbar](./bimlflex-tour#bimlflex-toolbar).
