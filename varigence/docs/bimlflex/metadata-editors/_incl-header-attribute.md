[**Attributes**](bimlflex-attribute-editor) are used to conditionally override [**Configurations**](bimlflex-configuration-editor) and [**Settings**](bimlflex-setting-editor), and are one of the ways detailed customizations can be defined in BimlFlex. They can also be used to extend the metadata model for bespoke coding requirements.

Attributes are created as a result of specifically defining an override in either configuration or settings, for example by enabling a global setting but excluding specific objects from it. Attributes can be viewed and modified in the [**Attribute Editor**](bimlflex-attribute-editor) in the [BimlFlex App](metadata-editors-overview).

The attribute editor provides an alternative view using the [**Treeview**](bimlflex-treeview), at object level, on the specific overrides that apply to the data solution.
