# BimlStudio Project Setup For BimlFlex

A BimlStudio project is used to build and generate the metadata configured in BimlFlex.

## Create the BimlStudio Project

<InclHeaderBimlstudioProject />

## Connect to the BimlFlex Database

<InclHeaderBimlstudioConnect />

## Building Assets

Once the user is content with the configuration of their metadata, they are ready to build their assets for the configured target architecture and technology. At this stage, the user should already have a [BimlFlex project for BimlStudio](./setup-bimlstudio-project) ready to go.



:::note

Any time a change is made in the metadata, it is required to build the project and deploy the generated artifacts to update the solution.

:::
