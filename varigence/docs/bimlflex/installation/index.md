## Ensuring Correct Bitness For The Excel Add-In

Both Microsoft Office Excel and the BimlFlex Excel installation comes in two bitness flavors, 32-bit and 64-bit. The installed BimlFlex version needs to match the bitness of the installed version of Excel. This is initially set during installation of the BimlFlex App, but can be modified afterwards.
