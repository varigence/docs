BimlFlex provides several sets of [sample metadata](./sample-metadata) and configurations.

These samples support various common use-cases and scenarios and are intended to assist adopting specific features for certain architectures and technical environments. The full list of available samples is available in the [samples documentation](./sample-metadata#available-metadata-samples).

For example, samples cover how to load files using [SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)](../technology-ssis), how to implement [delete detection](../concepts/delete-detection) to load data into Azure, or how to deliver a [Data Vault](../delivering-data-vault) model on [Snowflake](../technology-snowflake).

In the [BimlFlex App](../metadata-editors), use the **Load Sample Metadata** button in the **Getting Started** pane on the [Dashboard](../metadata-editors/dashboard) to load sample metadata to the current active **Customer**.
