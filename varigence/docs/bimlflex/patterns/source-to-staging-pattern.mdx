# Source to Staging Project Pattern

The following pattern, outlined below, details the customary route to establish a Source to Staging workflow within the BimlFlex application.

The pattern provided is fundamental in scope.
The pattern attempts to address deviations from a "standard" Source to Staging workflow by indicating what settings can be modified to alter the workflow to fit your organization's intended data solution(s).

## Pattern Requirements

The sole requirement for this pattern is that the Project Source connection is of *INTEGRATION STAGE* `Source System`.

Configure the *INTEGRATION STAGE* by first selecting **Connections** from the left side menu, selecting your source connection from the navigation tree, and then the *INTEGRATION STAGE* dropdown menu in the Details tab.

## Source to Staging: Start

Begin by selecting in-scope attributes from the Source Connection.
"In-scope" attributes include adding applicable **Objects** and **Columns.**

Configure *OBJECT TYPE* by selecting **Objects** from the left side menu:

Configure *CHANGE TYPE* by selecting **Columns** from the left side menu:

## Source to Staging: Decision Points

The next setting to consider when designing your Source to Staging architecture is whether to collapse rows.Collapsing rows is a form of "de-duping" records that do not show a delta.

![Source to Staging - Collapse Rows](/img/bimlflex/source-staging-collapse-rows.png "Collapse Rows")

Configure the setting to collapse rows by selecting **Settings** from the left side menu, and then navigating to the **Staging** Setting Group. *SELECT STAGE ROW DISTINCT* can be toggled from this menu.

The next setting to consider is whether to convert data types according to BimlFlex settings. **Data Type Mappings** are applied when the **Column** has a *DATA TYPE MAPPING* value.

![Source to Staging - Convert Data Types](/img/bimlflex/source-staging-convert-data-types.png "Convert Data Types")

Configure this setting within BimlFlex by selecting **Columns** from the left side menu then selecting a column from within the navigation tree. *DATATYPE MAPPING* can be applied from this screen.

## Source to Staging: Additional Configurations

Next, set additional configurations regarding FlexRowEffectiveFromDate and RecordSource.

![Source to Staging - FlexRow and RecordSource](/img/bimlflex/source-staging-flexrow-recordsource.png "Additional Configurations")

Configure *STAGING ATTRIBUTE* by selecting **Configurations** from the left side menu.
Various configuration settings can be selected from the navigation tree.

## Source to Staging: Persist History Options

The Source to Staging pattern can go in multiple directions based on your organization's decision regarding whether to persist the history of your Staging Area.

![Source to Staging - Persist History Tree](/img/bimlflex/source-staging-persist-history-tree.png "Persist History Tree")

If it has been decided that you **will** persist history of your Staging Area, reference the pattern for Persistent Staging Area here: **insert link**

The Persistent Staging Area pattern usage is dictated by the *PERSISTENT STAGE CONNECTION* setting.
Configure this setting by selecting **Projects** from the left side menu.

![Source to Staging - Persistent Stage Connection](/img/bimlflex/source-staging-persistent-stage-connection.png "Persistent Stage Connection")

If not persisting the history in the staging area, the next option is whether the connection to Staging has a Data Vault target connection.
