**Attribute Types** are applied using the [**Attribute Editor**](../../metadata-editors/attribute-editor) and govern the scope for which the **Attribute** is applied. Selecting the attribute type will then show available options for the selected type.

The following options are available:

| Attribute Type  | Code | Description                          |
| --------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------ |
