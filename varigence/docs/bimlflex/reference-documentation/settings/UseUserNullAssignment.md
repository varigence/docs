# Use User Null Assignment

Specifies whether all non-key columns should be set as nullable or if their nullability is determined by user-defined input. It's advised against setting columns as non-nullable, as this may result in data load failures.

Notes:

* This setting is part of the *Core* settings category.
* The default value for this setting is `N`.
