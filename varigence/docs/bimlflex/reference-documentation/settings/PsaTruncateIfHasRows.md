# Truncate PSA If Has Rows

Determines if the PSA table should be truncated if it already contains records. This should be disabled for normal PSA behavior. Enable this for specific requirements where previously loaded rows should be discarded.

Notes:

* This setting is part of the *Staging Persistent* settings category.
* The default value for this setting is `N`.
