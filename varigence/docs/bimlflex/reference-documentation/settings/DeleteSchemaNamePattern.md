# Delete Schema Name Pattern

The name to use for the Delete objects schema when using Delete detection. "@@rs" uses the Record Source of the connection as schema. (This is the same default behavior as for the Staging tables). Update this to use a specific schema for delete tables

Notes:

* This setting is part of the *Staging Naming* settings category.
* The default value for this setting is `@@rs`.
