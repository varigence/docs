# Delta Use Hash Diff

Enable this option to use Hash Diff comparisons for Change Data Capture and Change Tracking sources. This method provides a more robust way to identify and capture only the changes, but may increase load time.

Notes:

* This setting is part of the *Staging Persistent* settings category.
* The default value for this setting is `Y`.
