# Apply Lookup Filter

Determines if the SSIS Lookup checks for existing rows and applies a filter condition when joining the source table to the destination table. This applies to Data Mart processing and aims to optimize memory usage.

Use if source and destination are co-located in the same database or if cross-database joins are possible.

Notes:

* This setting is part of the *Data Mart* settings category.
* The default value for this setting is `Y`.
