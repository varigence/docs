# Use Cache Lookup

Determines if the PSA lookup caches the data to disk when using SSIS. Use this if it is not possible to use the normal in-memory lookup behavior due to memory constraints.

Notes:

* This setting is part of the *Staging Persistent* settings category.
* The default value for this setting is `N`.
