# Configurations

The BimlFlex [**Configurations**](../../metadata-editors/configuration-editor) allow for the creation and management of custom attributes which can assist in driving the behavior of the BimlFlex output.

## Overview
  
| <div style={{ width: '200px' }}>Property</div> | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
|Configuration Key | The unique name of the selected configuration.|
|Configuration Value | This column contains the value to be returned when the configuration is accessed by the framework. This attribute allows you to define naming conventions custom to your environment.|
|Configuration Data Type | The definition of the data type for a configuration being used in the solution output. Here you should enter the data type using the following format "DATATYPENAME".|
|Length | The length of the column that is part of the configuration.|
|Precision | The precision of the column that is part of the configuration.|
|Scale | The scale of the column that is part of the configuration.|
|Configuration Default | The value that will used by the configuration if no **Configuration Value** has been specified.|
|Configuration Group | The category the configuration belongs to.|
|Configuration Order | The ordinal sequence for the configuration.|
|SQL Source Expression | SQL expression for this column is used to extend source queries. Generally used for source type casting and case statements.<br/><br/>Example: `CONVERT(VARCHAR(27), @@this, 121)`|
|SQL Target Expression | SQL expression for this column is used to extend target queries. Generally used for source type casting and case statements.<br/><br/>Example: `CONVERT(VARCHAR(27), @@this, 121)`|
|Pushdown Source Expression | Pushdown Extraction SQL expression for this column is used to extend source queries. Generally used for source type casting and case statements.<br/><br/>Example: `CONVERT(VARCHAR(27), @@this, 121)`|
|Pushdown Target Expression | Pushdown Extraction SQL expression for this column is used to extend target queries. Generally used for source type casting and case statements.<br/><br/>Example: `CONVERT(VARCHAR(27), @@this, 121)`|
|SSIS Dataflow Expression | This value specifies the expression used to calculate the value of the derived column. The SSIS expression syntax is used. Utilize the same syntax as the Derived Column.|
|ADF Copy Expression | This value specifies the expression used to calculate the value of the derived column. The ADF Copy Activity expression syntax is used. Utilize the same syntax as the Derived Column.|
|ADF Dataflow Expression | This value specifies the expression used to calculate the value of the derived column. The ADF Dataflow expression syntax is used. Utilize the same syntax as the Derived Column.|
|Nullable | This column allows to you define if the configuration value is allowed to be null.|
