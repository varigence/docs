# Package Tool Windows Overview

Certain tool windows only appear when a package is opened in the package editor. These tool windows are specifically for editing the properties of packages and their child items. They are listed below in alphabetical order.

* Event Handlers - Edit the event's name, and modify its type, in the data grid row. Beneath the data grid, use the designer surface to create a workflow for the event.
