Use the Biml editor to edit Biml files.

Every item in the Logical View has an associated Biml file. While the item's editor and the property grid can typically provide complete customization for an item, it may be convenient to alter Biml directly.

Syntax highlighting, quick info popups, and Intelliprompt are all available.
