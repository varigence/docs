# Package Editor

Use the package editor to construct and edit a control flow in a package.

Add tasks that support data flow, data preparation, perform BI functions, and execute scripts. Add containers that can repeat workflows or divide a control flow into subsets. Connect containers and tasks into an ordered control flow using precedence constraints.
