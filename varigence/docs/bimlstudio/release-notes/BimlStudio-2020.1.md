# BimlStudio 2020 R1 Release Notes

Significant changes between BimlStudio 2019 R1 and BimlStudio 2020 R1

## SSIS
* Fixed issue in `ScriptComponents` where they were not emitting the right Version number, causing build errors in SSIS.
* Added Direction property to `OLEDB Source` parameters.
* Fixed a typo where the word "will" was displayed as "WILL" in a few object descriptions.

* Fixed bug where `SsisDataTypeOverride` properties were not being used in column nodes.
* Fixed bug where `ExportColumn Task` columns had an invalid reference id. 
* Fixed casing issue on emission of VersionGUID for SSIS Projects
* Fixed issue where Flat File definitions did not support the use of brace-wrapped shorthand as in the SSDT designer. For example: {CRLF} in place of /r/n
* Fixed bug in `AdoNetConnection`, `AnalysisServices`, `ExcelConnection`, `OdbcConnection`, `OleDbConnection`, `OracleConnection` and `SqlServerPdwConnection` nodes where `RetainSameConnection` property was not being correctly emitted.
* Added support for `Teradata ODBC` provider
* Added root guard to XSD parsing to prevent root_ID column from being added to simple `XML Source` column collections.
* Improved `SMOConnection` support.
* Fixed bug that prevented packages with `CDCSplitter` components from building.

* Removed command properties that were erroneously showing in the property grid.
* Made the "Suspend Background Processing" feature persist across project close and reopen.

* Added an error when the BimlFlex.bimlb default bundle cannot be found.
* Updated all references of 2019 to 2020.
* Changed BimlFlex project creation defaults in BimlStudio
* Fixed issue where renaming Bundle Extensions failed.
* Build now fails on BSPCAP failure.

* Fixed bug where KVS Linked Service references were not emitting correctly in json.
* Fixed typo by renaming ADF assets from `Magneto` to `Magento`.

* Added support for all source nodes inside of `LookupActivity`.
* Added support for `AdditionalColumns` collections inside of most dataset sources.
* Changed the way we emit column mappings in copy activities to conform with ADF's `mapping` collection.
* Added `TimeoutQuery` property to all `Tabular` dataset sources.

## Command Line Builds

* Multiple bundle extension targets can be listed and separated by comma or semicolon.
