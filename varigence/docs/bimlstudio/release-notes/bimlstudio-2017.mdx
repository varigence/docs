# Significant changes between Mist 4.0 Update 1 and BimlStudio 2017

**Breaking Changes**

- Moved PathAnnotation from PrecedenceConstraints to TaskflowInputPath.
- Clean output folder is now set to false by default in AstEngine's compiler settings.
- Fixed issue in CallBimlScript property directives where all properties were required and marking them as required would create an error. To fix this, we apply all of the required properties first and then the optional properties in order of specification. Since required properties basically didn't work before, this shouldn't affect any actual code, but it should be called out as a potentially significant behavioral change.

**BimlStudio Rebranding**

- Updated version to BimlStudio 2017 v5.0.
- Updated splash screens, logos, and color scheme to match Biml color scheme.
- Removed all instances of the text "Mist" from the product and all code. If you were using any unsupported Mist APIs, replace all instances of "Mist" with "BimlStudio".
- Updated BimlStudio version to 5.0 in the Registry.

**Major Features**

- Biml global includes
- Biml Bundles
- New source control UI including Git, Visual Studio Online, and Team Explorer Everywhere support
- Significant performance improvements
- New installer
- SSIS 2016 support
- SSAS Tabular Emission
- Usability enhancements throughout the UI
- Added multi-product support to license keys and better offline support

**Platform**

- Moved all DLLs and executables to use .NET 4.6 rather than .NET 3.5.
- Removed warnings from a couple of framework transformers.
- BimlStudio is now truly x86 or x64. This shouldn't be visible to end-users, but it was necessary to begin hosting HTML/JS/CSS controls natively in BimlStudio. The command line compiler is unaffected and remains AnyCPU.
- Updated EULA to cover frameworks including BimlFlex.

**Biml Bundles**

- User Interface
- Bundles are now shown in project and logical views.
- Bundle designer added.
- Wired up bundle settings editor.
- Biml Language
- Added the `<#@ extension #>` directive to customize BimlBundle extension points.
- Biml API
- Added extension and bundle related Call methods to FlowTextTransformation.
- Biml Code Editor
- Added intelliprompt for extension bundles and extension points. targets still need to be done.
- Added ability to specify templates to a command line build to support extension discovery.
- Added support for passing template files into builds so that bundles can use them to find extensions, among other benefits.
- Added support for passing bundles into builds.
- Added support for specifying that a framework or a transformer lives inside a bundle.
- Added initial support for bundle overrides.
- Added msbuild and command line inputs for BimlFrameworkBundleFilePath,TransformationScriptBundle, Bundles, BundleOverrides, and Templates.
- Fixed crashing issue when PluginDirectory doesn't exist. This only manifested in BimlOnline.
- Updated PathResolver to work with Bundles. There is some more stabilization and testing to do - especially around *BUNDLE* paths.
- Added support for Bundle setting management and serialization.
- Manifests
- Added icon support for EP categories in bundles.
- Added new file template support in bundles for Eps.
- Added the ability to split manifest files in two, including a common file and multiple variants for application specific bundle modes.

**BimlFlex**

- Added Extension Point information to BimlFlex ribbon.

**Performance**

- Added lazy loading of collections to BimlStudio view models.  This will significantly reduce memory consumption for large projects.
- Improved performance of CallBimlScript by around 30X by adding caching when possible.
- Added caching of internal build information for ScriptTask Projects and Script Component Projects.  This will massively increase build performance where the same script task or component is reused in many locations in a project (provided that the ProjectCoreName is also reused).
- Added caching to dynamically generated metadata model class, which provides massive performance improvement for RelatedItem interrogation in large metadata instances.
- Memory improvements when closing documents.
- Improved performance issue in the editor when there were large blocks of plain text.

**Logical View**

- Fixed issue where generating the DropAndCreateDDL from BimlStudio context menu would crash Mist if the table had errors.
- Added persistence of logical view expansion state between invocations of BimlStudio.
- Added a new Bundle Extensions group to the Library of the Logical View.
- Fixed bugs with logical display folder calculations when files can jump between multiple filtered folders (Utilities, Transformers, Extensions).
- Added delete confirmation dialogs for measure groups and dimensions in the logical view.
- Adding "Delete Unscripted" to top-level Logical View nodes.

**Biml Code Editor**

- Fixed issue where opening a standalone Biml file could crash Mist.
- Fixed quick info and code completion in standalone Biml files.
- Improve selection highlighting styles in BimlEditor to make it easier to read.
