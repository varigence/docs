# BimlStudio 2019 R1 Release Notes

Significant changes between BimlStudio 2018 R3 and BimlStudio 2019 R1

## SSIS

* Removed NoXML validation for `SQL Server` index nodes as they can now have XML datatypes.
* Fixed bug where `Annotations` created on `OutputBuffer` columns were not being persisted.
* Fixed bug where `Container` property `TransactionOption` was being evaluated as an object rather than an `int32`.
* Fixed typo in `MergeJoin` error message.
* Added fix to correctly emit `BlobColumns` in `BufferWrapper.cs` for ScriptProjects. 
* Added SqlServer 2019 support. 
* Added SSIS 2019 support. 
* Removed `Codepage` property from FlatFileFormat Columns, as the codepage gets set on the `FlatFileFormat` and is not configurable at the column level.
* Fixed bug in `GetQuerySchema()`, where column nodes were not correctly reading `ComputedText` and `IsNullable` properties.

## BimlStudio Improvements
* Removed the live assets checkbox from the logical view as it was confusing and no longer valuable for modern users of BimlStudio.
* The validator is now suspended during background compilation to improve performance and prevent the temporary appearance of spurious errors.

* Fixed typo in the error message of `AzureDataLakeStoreGen1LinkedService` when no `ServicePrincipalKey` or `ServicePrincipalKeyKVS` are set.

* Added support for `SetVariable` activity.
* Added support for `AppendVariable` activity.
* Added ability to emit json with nested arrays.
* Universally renamed `KeyVaultSecret` properties to `KVS` in order to aid with brevity and avoid naming collisions (e.g. `ServicePrincipalKeyKVS` is much more favorable to `ServicePrincipalKeyKeyVaultSecret`

* Added support for `DatabricksPython` activity.
* Placed a 40 activity limit on pipeline nodes.
* Changed `SqlServerLinkedServiceBase` linked service `StoredProcedureName` property to an attribute from a child.

* Added `ScriptActions`, `ZookeeperNodeSize`, `DataNodeSize`, and `HeadNodeSize` properties to `HdInsightOnDemand` Linked Services.
* Added `DependsOn` collection to `TumblingWindow` Triggers.
* Added custom validation to prevent both `SecretAccess` and `SecretAccessKVS` from being configured at the same time for `AmazonS3` Linked Services.
* Added custom validation to ensure that `RedirectRowSettings` are configured when `EnableSkipIncompatibleRow` is configured in Copy Activities.
* In some dataset types, we made the `FolderPath`property optional.
* Changed pipeline parameter datatype enum to match ADF rather than using `Db.Type`.
* Added pipeline `Variables` property, and linked them to the `SetVariable` and `AppendVariable` activities.
* Fixed a bug where nested arrays were not emitting correctly.
