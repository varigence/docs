# New Features in 2.0

Mist 2.0 and Biml 2.0 add several important new features to the available functionality.

* **BimlScript Intelliprompt**
  BimlScript now supports intelliprompt inside of C# code blocks. It supports all the standard C# functionality, as well as the Biml language model.
* **Import Existing Packages**
  Existing SSIS packages can be imported into a Mist project as Biml code. This enables developers to leverage existing investments in SSIS packages, while gaining the benefits of working with Biml.
* **Relational Model Updates**
  The relational model in Biml 2.0 has been enhanced to support relational partitions. It has also been upgraded to better support for multiple databases in the same project.
