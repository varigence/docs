# Setting up for the Sample

To build the sample in this walkthrough, some initial setup is required.

1. Install the AdventureWorksLT database on the target SQL server. This sample database is available on GitHub. Because the database sample is dependent on the SQL Server version, download the appropriate version for the target SQL Server.
1. Download samples databases from here: [https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/adventureworks](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/adventureworks)
1. Create a database on the SQL server named AdventureWorksLTDataMart.
