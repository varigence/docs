# BimlStudio User Guide

The BimlStudio User Guide describes all aspects of the BimlStudio user interface.

The BimlStudio User Guide is organized in three parts.

* Step by step walkthrough for building assets for use in a sample cube, leveraging the AdventureWorksLT database
* Description of each BimlStudio editor, tool window, and ribbon button
* Miscellaneous topics that don't fit into the first two groups

## BimlStudio Forum

If you have questions that aren't addressed in this guide, you can search and post in the [BimlStudio forum](http://www.varigence.com/Forums?forumName=BimlStudio) for help.

## Email Support

While the forums are the best way to get answers, if your question contains proprietary, or other, information that you would prefer not to post publicly, private email support is available at [support@varigence.com](mailto:support@varigence.com)
