# Varigence Documentation

Product documentation contents is located in their respective folder.

## Templates and styling

The documentation site is built using DocFX. [Download DocFX](https://github.com/dotnet/docfx/releases) as a release zip, expand to a folder and add that folder, with docfx.exe, to the path.

Content is stored in MarkDown (md) files. Use linting and adhere to best practices for markdown formatting as well as for file names for DocFX.

Guidelines for DocFX based markdown format and styling can be [found here](http://dotnet.github.io/docfx/spec/docfx_flavored_markdown.html)

The rendering engine is Markdig. Additional styling and formatting options described at the [Markdig GitHub page](https://github.com/lunet-io/markdig). This allows direct embedding of YouTube videos etc. using Markdown syntax rather than html.

Table of contents files are stored as toc.yml files. Refer to the [DocFX page on toc's](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/tutorial/intro_toc.html) for more information
